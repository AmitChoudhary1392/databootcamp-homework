Then we can know how to watch for early signs of the emergence of this type of thinking and move against it. This book addresses itself to this problem and arrives at new answers. Modern science and philosophy have gradually become aware of the degree to which human beings use different sets of assumptions about the nature of reality (how things are and work) in different situations. As this book demonstrates, when the ""Mythic"" world picture is used to solve political problems (instead of the appropriate ""Sensory"" world view) the concentration camp becomes a possibility.

An incredible novel that focuses on one of the people who had the most influence during World War I and World War II: Clementine Churchill. In 1909, Clementine steps off a train with her new husband, Winston. An angry woman emerges from the crowd to attack, shoving him in the direction of an oncoming train. Just before he stumbles, Clementine grabs him by his suit jacket. This will not be the last time Clementine Churchill will save her husband.

Also by Marie Benedict: The Only Woman in the Room The Other Einstein Carnegie's Maid Praise for Lady Clementine: ""Benedict is a true master at weaving the threads of the past into a compelling story for today. Here is the fictionalized account of the person who was the unequivocal wind beneath Winston Churchill's wings — a woman whose impact on the world-shaper that was WW2 has been begging to be told. A remarkable story of remarkable woman.""—Susan Meissner, bestselling author of The Last Year of the War ""The atmospheric prose of Marie Benedict draws me in every single time. Lady Clementine's powerful and spirited story is both compelling and immersive. Benedict fully inhabits the measured and intelligent voice of Clementine Churchill.

It began on New Year’s Eve. The sickness came on suddenly, and spread quickly. The fear spread even faster. Within weeks, everything people counted on began to fail them. The electrical grid sputtered; law and government collapsed—and more than half of the world’s population was decimated. Where there had been order, there was now chaos. And as the power of science and technology receded, magick rose up in its place. Some of it is good, like the witchcraft worked by Lana Bingham, practicing in the loft apartment she shares with her lover, Max. Some of it is unimaginably evil, and it can lurk anywhere, around a corner, in fetid tunnels beneath the river—or in the ones you know and love the most. As word spreads that neither the immune nor the gifted are safe from the authorities who patrol the ravaged streets, and with nothing left to count on but each other, Lana and Max make their way out of a wrecked New York City. At the same time, other travelers are heading west too, into a new frontier. Chuck, a tech genius trying to hack his way through a world gone offline. Arlys, a journalist who has lost her audience but uses pen and paper to record the truth. Fred, her young colleague, possessed of burgeoning abilities and an optimism that seems out of place in this bleak landscape. And Rachel and Jonah, a resourceful doctor and a paramedic who fend off despair with their determination to keep a young mother and three infants in their care alive. In a world of survivors where every stranger encountered could be either a savage or a savior, none of them knows exactly where they are heading, or why.

['Jodi Picoult'],Fiction,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Small Great Things and the modern classics My Sister’s Keeper, The Storyteller, and more, comes a “complex, compassionate, and smart” (The Washington Post) novel about a family torn apart by a murder accusation. When your son can’t look you in the eye…does that mean he’s guilty? Jacob Hunt is a teen with Asperger’s syndrome. He’s hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, though he is brilliant in many ways. He has a special focus on one subject—forensic analysis. A police scanner in his room clues him in to crime scenes, and he’s always showing up and telling the cops what to do. And he’s usually right. But when Jacob’s small hometown is rocked by a terrible murder, law enforcement comes to him. Jacob’s behaviors are hallmark Asperger’s, but they look a lot like guilt to the local police. Suddenly the Hunt family, who only want to fit in, are thrust directly in the spotlight. For Jacob’s mother, it’s a brutal reminder of the intolerance and misunderstanding that always threaten her family. For his brother, it’s another indication why nothing is normal because of Jacob.

Ray Bradbury’s internationally acclaimed novel Fahrenheit 451 is a masterwork of twentieth-century literature set in a bleak, dystopian future. Guy Montag is a fireman. In his world, where television rules and literature is on the brink of extinction, firemen start fires rather than put them out. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But then he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television.

Yet when Darby befriends Esme, a Barbizon maid, she's introduced to an entirely new side of New York City: seedy downtown jazz clubs where the music is as addictive as the heroin that's used there, the startling sounds of bebop, and even the possibility of romance. Over half a century later, the Barbizon's gone condo and most of its long-ago guests are forgotten. But rumors of Darby's involvement in a deadly skirmish with a hotel maid back in 1952 haunt the halls of the building as surely as the melancholy music that floats from the elderly woman's rent-controlled apartment. It's a combination too intoxicating for journalist Rose Lewin, Darby's upstairs neighbor, to resist—not to mention the perfect distraction from her own imploding personal life. Yet as Rose's obsession deepens, the ethics of her investigation become increasingly murky, and neither woman will remain unchanged when the shocking truth is finally revealed.",JKRcCwAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JKRcCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9781101985007,en,288, ,Penguin,"{'ratings_count': 26714, 'reviews_count': 73895, 'text_reviews_count': 2727, 'average_rating': '3.76', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '5346', '4-stars': '11682', '3-stars': '7811', '2-stars': '1611', '1-star': '264'}}",historical-fiction,The Dollhouse,26714,73895,2727,3.76

There's a village an hour from London. It's no different from many others today: one pub, one church, red-brick cottages, some public housing, and a few larger houses dotted about. Voices rise up, as they might anywhere, speaking of loving and needing and working and dying and walking the dogs. This village belongs to the people who live in it, to the land and to the land's past. It also belongs to Dead Papa Toothwort, a fabled figure local schoolchildren used to draw green and leafy, choked by tendrils growing out of his mouth, who awakens after a glorious nap.

That Wall executes it so beautifully? Well, this is exactly why we read literary fiction...The best book about faith in recent memory.” —Entertainment Weekly (A-) “When I began reading The Dearly Beloved I braced for piety, worried it might be a book only a believer could appreciate. Instead, I found myself carried along by Cara Wall’s luminous prose, and then by these characters and their stories. I saw myself in their doubts, in their hopes. There is no moralizing here, only empathy.

As the book opens in 2001, it is the evening of sixteen-year-old Melody's coming of age ceremony in her grandparents' Brooklyn brownstone. Watched lovingly by her relatives and friends, making her entrance to the music of Prince, she wears a special custom-made dress. But the event is not without poignancy. Sixteen years earlier, that very dress was measured and sewn for a different wearer: Melody's mother, for her own ceremony-- a celebration that ultimately never took place. Unfurling the history of Melody's parents and grandparents to show how they all arrived at this moment, Woodson considers not just their ambitions and successes but also the costs, the tolls they've paid for striving to overcome expectations and escape the pull of history. As it explores sexual desire and identity, ambition, gentrification, education, class and status, and the life-altering facts of parenthood, Red at the Bone most strikingly looks at the ways in which young people must so often make long-lasting decisions about their lives--even before they have begun to figure out who they are and what they want to be.",aGWMDwAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aGWMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780525535294,en,208, ,Penguin,"{'ratings_count': 21391, 'reviews_count': 101311, 'text_reviews_count': 3168, 'average_rating': '4.02', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '6993', '4-stars': '9093', '3-stars': '4254', '2-stars': '814', '1-star': '237'}}",fiction,Red at the Bone,21391,101311,3168,4.02

Superheroes have always been Leia Birch Briggs’ weakness. One tequila-soaked night at a comics convention, the usually level-headed graphic novelist is swept off her barstool by a handsome and anonymous Batman. It turns out the caped crusader has left her with more than just a nice, fuzzy memory. She’s having a baby boy—an unexpected but not unhappy development in the thirty-eight year-old’s life. But before Leia can break the news of her impending single-motherhood (including the fact that her baby is biracial) to her conventional, Southern family, her step-sister Rachel’s marriage implodes. Worse, she learns her beloved ninety-year-old grandmother, Birchie, is losing her mind, and she’s been hiding her dementia with the help of Wattie, her best friend since girlhood. Leia returns to Alabama to put her grandmother’s affairs in order, clean out the big Victorian that has been in the Birch family for generations, and tell her family that she’s pregnant. Yet just when Leia thinks she’s got it all under control, she learns that illness is not the only thing Birchie’s been hiding. Tucked in the attic is a dangerous secret with roots that reach all the way back to the Civil War. Its exposure threatens the family’s freedom and future, and it will change everything about how Leia sees herself and her sister, her son and his missing father, and the world she thinks she knows.",pmlEDQAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pmlEDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780062105738,en,298, ,HarperCollins,"{'ratings_count': 21366, 'reviews_count': 81947, 'text_reviews_count': 2737, 'average_rating': '3.97', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '5980', '4-stars': '9853', '3-stars': '4594', '2-stars': '752', '1-star': '187'}}",fiction,The Almost Sisters,21366,81947,2737,3.97

Plucky and ambitious, Marilla Cuthbert is thirteen years old when her world is turned upside down. Her beloved mother dies in childbirth, and Marilla suddenly must bear the responsibilities of a farm wife: cooking, sewing, keeping house, and overseeing the day-to-day life of Green Gables with her brother, Matthew and father, Hugh.

With a history of violence and bad decisions behind him and the threat of prison dogging his every step, he's determined to walk a straight line.

['André Aciman'],Fiction,"From André Aciman, the author of Call Me by Your Name (now a major motion picture and the winner of the OscarTM for Best Adapted Screenplay) comes “a sensory masterclass, absorbing, intelligent, unforgettable” (Times Literary Supplement). André Aciman, hailed as a writer of “fiction at its most supremely interesting” (The New York Review of Books), has written a novel that charts the life of a man named Paul, whose loves remain as consuming and as covetous throughout his adulthood as they were in his adolescence. Whether the setting is southern Italy, where as a boy he has a crush on his parents’ cabinetmaker, or a snowbound campus in New England, where his enduring passion for a girl he’ll meet again and again over the years is punctuated by anonymous encounters with men; whether he’s on a tennis court in Central Park, or on a New York sidewalk in early spring, his attachments are ungraspable, transient, and forever underwritten by raw desire—not for just one person’s body but, inevitably, for someone else’s as well. In Enigma Variations, Aciman maps the most inscrutable corners of passion, proving to be an unsparing reader of the human psyche and a master stylist. With language at once lyrical, bare-knuckled, and unabashedly candid, he casts a sensuous, shimmering light over each facet of desire to probe how we ache, want, and waver, and ultimately how we sometimes falter and let go of those who may want to offer only what we crave from them. Ahead of every step Paul takes, his hopes, denials, fears, and regrets are always ready to lay their traps. Yet the dream of love lingers. We may not always know what we want. We may remain enigmas to ourselves and to others. But sooner or later we discover who we’ve always known we were.",xBFeDAAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xBFeDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780374714772,en,288, ,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","{'ratings_count': 4777, 'reviews_count': 15482, 'text_reviews_count': 639, 'average_rating': '3.74', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '1109', '4-stars': '1853', '3-stars': '1366', '2-stars': '379', '1-star': '70'}}",fiction,Enigma Variations,4777,15482,639,3.74

['Alain De Botton'],Fiction,"In Edinburgh, a couple, Rabih and Kirsten, fall in love. They get married, they have children -- but no relationship is as simple as ""happily ever after."" The Course of Love is a novel that explores what happens after the birth of love, what it takes to maintain love, and what happens to our original ideals under the pressures of an average existence. With philosophical insight and psychological acumen, Alain de Botton shows that our Romantic dreams may do us a grave disservice -- and explores what the alternatives might be. The conclusion, as the characters gradually discover, is that love is not ""an enthusiasm,"" but rather a ""skill"" that must be slowly and often painfully learnt. This is a Romantic novel in the true sense, one interested in exploring how love can survive and thrive in the long term.",oXZpCgAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oXZpCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780771027628,en,240, ,Signal,"{'ratings_count': 21816, 'reviews_count': 60472, 'text_reviews_count': 2392, 'average_rating': '4.05', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '8039', '4-stars': '8382', '3-stars': '4081', '2-stars': '984', '1-star': '330'}}",fiction,The Course of Love,21816,60472,2392,4.05

In the summer of 1940, ambitious young American journalist Ruby Sutton gets her big break: the chance to report on the European war as a staff writer for Picture Weekly newsmagazine in London. She jumps at the chance, for it's an opportunity not only to prove herself, but also to start fresh in a city and country that know nothing of her humble origins. But life in besieged Britain tests Ruby in ways she never imagined. Although most of Ruby's new colleagues welcome her, a few resent her presence, not only as an American but also as a woman. She is just beginning to find her feet, to feel at home in a country that is so familiar yet so foreign, when the bombs begin to fall. As the nightly horror of the Blitz stretches unbroken into weeks and months, Ruby must set aside her determination to remain an objective observer. When she loses everything but her life, and must depend upon the kindness of strangers, she learns for the first time the depth and measure of true friendship—and what it is to love a man who is burdened by secrets that aren’t his to share.

In an effort to thwart Grindelwald’s plans, Albus Dumbledore enlists Newt, his former Hogwarts student, who agrees to help once again, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead.

The New York Times Como un mismo tema musical (el del erotismo, los recuerdos y el cuerpo) tocado en sus diversas variaciones, así son los vínculos de Paul con las diferentes personas que han ido dando forma a lo que él entiende por amor. Hombres y mujeres con los que se ha encontrado desde su adolescencia en Italia hasta su madurez en Estados Unidos.

"['Douglas Preston', 'Lincoln Child']",Fiction,"Racing to uncover the mystery of several light green-shoe-clad severed feet found floating in the Atlantic, Agent Pendergast is faced with most inexplicable challenge of his career in this installment of the #1 NYT bestselling series. A STARTLING CRIME WITH DOZENS OF VICTIMS. Appearing out of nowhere to horrify the quiet resort town of Sanibel Island, Florida, dozens of identical, ordinary-looking shoes float in on the tide and are washed up on the tropical beach--each one with a crudely severed human foot inside. A GHASTLY ENIGMA WITH NO APPARENT SOLUTION. Called away from vacation elsewhere in the state, Agent Pendergast reluctantly agrees to visit the crime scene--and, despite himself, is quickly drawn in by the incomprehensible puzzle. An early pathology report only adds to the mystery. With an ocean of possibilities confronting the investigation, no one is sure what happened, why, or from where the feet originated. And they desperately need to know: are the victims still alive? A WORTHY CHALLENGE FOR A BRILLIANT MIND. In short order, Pendergast finds himself facing the most complex and inexplicable challenge of his career: a tangled thread of evidence that spans seas and traverses continents, connected to one of the most baffling mysteries in modern medical science. Through shocking twists and turns, all trails lead back to a powerful adversary with a sadistic agenda and who--in a cruel irony--ultimately sees in Pendergast the ideal subject for their malevolent research.",Opu5DwAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Opu5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,9781538747261,en,, ,Hachette UK,"{'ratings_count': 4104, 'reviews_count': 11007, 'text_reviews_count': 481, 'average_rating': '4.37', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '2173', '4-stars': '1398', '3-stars': '434', '2-stars': '72', '1-star': '27'}}",mystery,Crooked River,4104,11007,481,4.37

['Paula Fox'],Fiction,"Un famélico gato callejero muerde a Sophie cuando ésta le da de comer. Ella, una atractiva mujer de cuarenta años a la que la vida parece tratar muy bien, y Otto, su marido, forman una de esas parejas burguesas neoyorquinas de finales de los sesenta que podrían despertar la sana envidia de cualquiera: un Mercedes, casa en Long Island, las obras completas de Goethe en su biblioteca... El incidente del gato, en apariencia banal, desata una serie de pequeños e inquietantes desastres comienzan a jalonar su vida revelando fisuras de un matrimonio (y una sociedad) que se está desintegrando. Tras este arranque aparentemente anecdótico, tras la fina ironía de los diálogos y la sucesión de cataclismos domésticos que habrán de producirse, late la tragedia existencial que sustenta todas las historias de Paula Fox: la incapacidad de sus personajes para comprender la verdadera esencia de la vida, que subyace a la apariencia de las cosas, la complejidad de los sentimientos humanos y el desmoronamiento de una sociedad cada vez más artificiosa. Felizmente rescatada del olvido por el escritor norteamericano Jonathan Franzen, la narrativa de Paula Fox merece un lugar de privilegio entre los grandes nombres de su generación como Philip Roth, Saul Bellow o John Updike. Abandonada por sus padres al nacer, la vida de Paula Fox (Nueva York, 1923) es un continuo tránsito por hogares de acogida y ciudades (en Cuba, Estados Unidos, Europa y Canadá), durante el cual ejerce los más variados oficios, estudia letras en la Columbia University y, finalmente, ya en su madurez, decide dedicarse en plenitud a la creación literaria.Ha escrito más de treinta obras (La cometa rota, La danza de los esclavos, El gato tuerto, entre otras) para público infantil, cuyo conjunto se hizo merecedor del prestigioso premio Andersen en 1978. Su obra se completa con seis novelas para adultos entre las que cabe destacar Strange Characters, God of Nightmares y un libro de memorias, Elegancia prestada.",7wv3PQAACAAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7wv3PQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,8476697201,es,175, ,El Aleph Editores,"{'ratings_count': 4332, 'reviews_count': 20380, 'text_reviews_count': 556, 'average_rating': '3.65', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '945', '4-stars': '1634', '3-stars': '1187', '2-stars': '432', '1-star': '134'}}",fiction,Personajes desesperados,4332,20380,556,3.65
['Elena Ferrante'],Literary Collections,"Sigue las vivencias de las protagonistas de la saga «Dos amigas»: una historia de amistad que recorre los años más importantes del siglo XX. UNA SAGA MEMORABLE Érase una vez dos niñas, Elena y Lila, que nacieron en 1944 en un barrio pobre de la ciudad de Nápoles, y desde entonces su historia ha sido el hilo conductor de esta espléndida saga napolitana que ahora llega a su tercera entrega. Lila se casó muy joven con el hombre más adinerado del barrio y poco tardó en dejarlo. Ahora vive en un lugar miserable, pero su ingenio no ha mermado; solo se ha transformado en rabia. Es quizá este odio lo que la llevará a capitanear las revueltas en la fábrica y a negarse a una convivencia pacífica y modesta con su nuevo compañero. Elena, en cambio, ha continuado con los estudios e incluso ha escrito una novela. Ahora vive entre Nápoles y Pisa, y se ha casado con un profesor de la Universidad de Florencia. Así, a primera vista, nada une ya a las dos amigas, pero el barrio de Nápoles donde fueron niñas aún las reclama, las viejas costumbres las devuelven a un tiempo que ya se fue, y la vida se cobra su precio. Reseñas de autores, prensa y famosos que alaban la obra de Elena Ferrante: «Elena Ferrante es un vicio que se propaga de lector en lector.» Marian Izaguirre «Las novelas de Elena Ferrante me han tenido atado al sillón, leyendo y celebrando unas páginas donde la emoción nunca es banal: el dolor y la alegría de sentirse vivos están ahí para que el lector los haga suyos y todo lo que se dice es necesario, sin que sobre ni falte un solo adjetivo.» Juan Marsé «Lo maravilloso del enigma Ferrante es que podemos concentrarnos solo en sus obras.» Roberto Saviano «Quiero tanto a Lenù... Lloré leyéndola.» Jonathan Franzen «La magia de Elena Ferrante consiste en convertir la complejidad de lavida en una lectura apasionante.» Julia Montejo «Una mirada clara, lúcida, intensa.» La Vanguardia «Ferrante es un fenómeno literario. Le han rendido pleitesía Zadie Smith, Juan Marsé o Ken Follet, entre otros.» Núria Escur, La Vanguardia «Toda obra de arte pertenece a un autor, pero cuando es perfecta tiene algo de anónima.» Benjamín G. Rosado, Cultura (El Mundo) «Seguramente sea la revelación más trascendente de la narrativa europea en el último cuarto de siglo.» Robert Saladrigas, La Vanguardia «Ferrante es única.

The Bodine ranch and resort in western Montana is a family business, an idyllic spot for vacationers. A little over thirty thousand acres and home to four generations, it’s kept running by Bodine Longbow with the help of a large staff, including new hire Callen Skinner. There was another member of the family once: Bodine’s aunt, Alice, who ran off before Bodine was born. She never returned, and the Longbows don’t talk about her much. The younger ones, who never met her, quietly presume she’s dead. But she isn’t. She is not far away, part of a new family, one she never chose—and her mind has been shattered... When a bartender leaves the resort late one night, and Bo and Cal discover her battered body in the snow, it’s the first sign that danger lurks in the mountains that surround them.

['Erin Morgenstern'],Fiction,"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Night Circus, a timeless love story set in a secret underground world—a place of pirates, painters, lovers, liars, and ships that sail upon a starless sea. Zachary Ezra Rawlins is a graduate student in Vermont when he discovers a mysterious book hidden in the stacks. As he turns the pages, entranced by tales of lovelorn prisoners, key collectors, and nameless acolytes, he reads something strange: a story from his own childhood. Bewildered by this inexplicable book and desperate to make sense of how his own life came to be recorded, Zachary uncovers a series of clues—a bee, a key, and a sword—that lead him to a masquerade party in New York, to a secret club, and through a doorway to an ancient library hidden far below the surface of the earth. What Zachary finds in this curious place is more than just a buried home for books and their guardians—it is a place of lost cities and seas, lovers who pass notes under doors and across time, and of stories whispered by the dead. Zachary learns of those who have sacrificed much to protect this realm, relinquishing their sight and their tongues to preserve this archive, and also of those who are intent on its destruction. Together with Mirabel, a fierce, pink-haired protector of the place, and Dorian, a handsome, barefoot man with shifting alliances, Zachary travels the twisting tunnels, darkened stairwells, crowded ballrooms, and sweetly soaked shores of this magical world, discovering his purpose—in both the mysterious book and in his own life.",uYKDDwAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uYKDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,9780385541220,en,512, ,Doubleday,"{'ratings_count': 45057, 'reviews_count': 276582, 'text_reviews_count': 10849, 'average_rating': '3.95', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '18047', '4-stars': '13137', '3-stars': '8629', '2-stars': '3974', '1-star': '1270'}}",fantasy,The Starless Sea,45057,276582,10849,3.95

['André Aciman'],Fiction,"«Chiamami col tuo nome è stato celebrato per come ha saputo raccontare il tema della natura dell’amore, un tema che in Cercami viene portato avanti con grazia e profondità. La resa psicologica dei personaggi è vivida e acuta, ma ciò che in definitiva cattura l’interesse del lettore è scoprire se le vite incrociate dei due amanti, Elio e Oliver, si riuniranno. Si può solo sperarlo.» Booklist «Cercami è un romanzo toccante senza essere sentimentale. Una storia memorabile, di amore che dura oltre il tempo e le generazioni.» Kirkus Reviews «Questo romanzo dimostra, ancora una volta, come André Aciman sappia fondere l’aspetto sensuale e quello intellettuale in storie capaci di arrivare al cuore.» Publishers Weekly Sono passati parecchi anni da quell’estate in Riviera: Elio, in piena confusione adolescenziale, aveva scoperto la forza travolgente del primo amore grazie a Oliver, lo studente americano ospite del padre nella casa di famiglia. Erano stati giorni unici, in grado di segnare le loro vite con la forza di un desiderio incancellabile, nonostante ciascuno abbia poi proseguito per una strada diversa. Il nuovo romanzo di André Aciman si apre con l’incontro casuale su un treno tra un professore di mezza età e una giovane donna: lui è Samuel, il padre di Elio, sta andando a Roma per tenere una conferenza ed è ansioso di cogliere l’occasione per rivedere suo figlio, pianista affermato ma molto inquieto nelle questioni sentimentali; lei è una fotografa, carattere ribelle e refrattaria alle relazioni stabili, e in quell’uomo più maturo scopre la persona che avrebbe voluto conoscere da sempre. Tra i due nasce un’attrazione fortissima, che li porterà a mettere in discussione tutte le loro certezze. Anche per Elio il destino ha in serbo un incontro inaspettato a Parigi, che potrebbe assumere i contorni di un legame importante. Ma nulla può far sbiadire in lui il ricordo di Oliver, che vive a New York una vita apparentemente serena, è sposato e ha due figli adolescenti, eppure… Una parola, solo una parola, potrebbe bastare a riaprire una porta che in fondo non si è mai chiusa. Con la magistrale sensibilità che ha dimostrato nel raccontare i sentimenti, André Aciman riannoda i destini dei protagonisti di Chiamami col tuo nome, in un romanzo che si interroga e ci interroga sulla durata dell’amore, al di là del tempo e delle distanze.",OvC2DwAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OvC2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,9788823526211,it,278, ,Guanda,"{'ratings_count': 13968, 'reviews_count': 66928, 'text_reviews_count': 2357, 'average_rating': '3.35', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '2462', '4-stars': '3989', '3-stars': '4334', '2-stars': '2311', '1-star': '872'}}",fiction,Cercami,13968,66928,2357,3.35
['Charlotte Wood'],Fiction,"Three women in their seventies reunite for one last, life-changing weekend in the beach house of their late friend. Four older women have a lifelong friendship of the best kind: loving, practical, frank, and steadfast. But when Sylvie dies, the ground shifts dangerously for the remaining three. They are Jude, a once-famous restaurateur; Wendy, an acclaimed public intellectual; and Adele, a renowned actress now mostly out of work. Struggling to recall exactly why they've remained close all these years, the grieving women gather at Sylvie's old beach house—not for festivities this time, but to clean it out before it is sold. Can they survive together without her? Without Sylvie to maintain the group's delicate equilibrium, frustrations build and painful memories press in.

But when the two federal agents assigned to the investigation are taken out, the FBI takes a more personal interest in the case. Special Agent Ty Grady is pulled out of undercover work after his case blows up in his face. He's cocky, abrasive, and indisputably the best at what he does. But when he's paired with Special Agent Zane Garrett, it's hate at first sight. Garrett is the perfect image of an agent: serious, sober, and focused, which makes their partnership a classic cliche: total opposites, good cop-bad cop, the odd couple. They both know immediately that their partnership will pose more of an obstacle than the lack of evidence left by the murderer. Practically before their special assignment starts, the murderer strikes again - this time at them.

Alone and rudderless in New York, he is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. He is tormented by an unbearable longing for his mother, and down the years clings to the thing that most reminds him of her: a small, strangely captivating painting that ultimately draws him into the criminal underworld.

['Shana Abe'],Fiction,"From Shana Abé, author of The Truelove Bride and A Kiss at Midnight, comes this exquisitely emotional, beautifully written novel about two warring clans on a Scottish isle united by a fragile pact... and the hearts of two unforgettable lovers. Lauren MacRae is only a woman. But her father's death has left her the leader of the Clan MacRae. Now it is up to her to defend her beloved Isle of Shot from the invading Northmen, even if it means going to her clan's sworn enemy, the powerful English overlord, Arion du Morgan, for help. But Arion's raven hair, green eyes, and smoldering sensuality soon make Lauren forget just why she turned to him—as he awakens within her a wayward desire.... Like Lauren, Arion risks the mutiny of his soldiers by forming this risky alliance. But he was brought up to believe that the Isle of Shot belongs not to the Clan MacRae, but to England—and he will defend it to his dying breath. Once, when they were children, Arion saved Lauren from a tortuous fate. Now, the copper-haired beauty has somehow found a way to banish the emptiness in his soul. And as they join forces to fight for the land they both love, he will risk everything—even his very life—to claim what is his.

Gerhardt Praeger, a farmer of some education and plenty experience, understands the mixture of hard work, ingenuity, ethic, grace and steadiness of spirit needed to hold his settler family and neighboring community together while homesteading the hard territory of the Dakotas. He, along with his wife and seven sons, must constantly contend with natural disasters and manmade challenges to carve out their holdings in an unforgiving environment that has defeated so many of their neighbors, sending them home to their families back east. Praeger believes that God will provide sufficiently if not in abundance to those who can resist over-reaching. But a new neighbor, the bold Beidermann, who seems at times almost larger than life, stirs both his curiosity and envy, and tests Praeger's moral beliefs. Between his remarkable journal entries that observe the increasingly tense events between them, is also a narrative that moves the everyone toward calamity.

""A lyrical work of self-discovery that's shockingly intimate and insistently universal...Not so much briefly gorgeous as permanently stunning."" --Ron Charles, The Washington Post Poet Ocean Vuong's debut novel is a shattering portrait of a family, a first love, and the redemptive power of storytelling On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born -- a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam -- and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard. With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.

From the creator of the much-loved Constable Evan Evans mysteries comes a colorful new series set in turn-of-the-century New York City. When spirited redhead Molly Murphy was growing up a peasant on the coast of Ireland she always imagined there was something more in store for her. She couldn't have known how right she was until the day she became a murderer, albeit in self-defense. Under drastic circumstances, Molly is forced to strike out into a new world. With the police right behind her, Molly's only chance at escape is a false identity and a steamship that will take her far, far away: to America. When her ship sails into New York Harbor, with the majestic figure of the Statue of Liberty providing comfort and inspiration, Molly is sure her whole life is in front of her. But she's got one last hurdle to clear: Ellis Island. She is just one among thousands of immigrants on the tiny island, awaiting their fate with anxiety and hope. Unfortunately for Molly, before she is able to leave the island a man is brutally murdered, his throat cut from ear to ear, and coincidence and fate make her a suspect in a crime she didn't commit. Under a cloud of suspicion, and due largely to a growing mutual attraction between Molly and the handsome police captain in charge of the case, she is allowed to leave Ellis Island for Manhattan. Unfortunately, she's got a mission she couldn't have anticipated: clear her own name of murder. Alone in a new country with no one to lean on, Molly hits the vibrant streets of New York intent on finding out what really happened. After all, if she can't, she'll be sent back to Ireland, where the dreaded gallows await. With the sweeping skyline of 19th century New York and the gritty, pulsating underworld of recently arrived immigrants forming a vivid backdrop, Rhys Bowen transports readers back in time to America's not-so-distant past.

['Harriet Beecher Stowe'],Fiction,"It is the best known book about American slavery, and was so incendiary upon its first publication in 1852 that it actually ignited the social flames that led to Civil War less than a decade later. What began as a series of sketches for the Cincinnati abolitionist newspaper The National Era scandalized the North, was banned in the South, and ultimately became the bestselling novel of the 19th century. Today, controversy over this melodramatic tale of the dignified slave Tom, the brutal plantation owner Simon Legree, and Stowe's other vividly drawn characters continues, as modern scholars debate the work's newly appreciated feminist undertones and others decry it as the source of enduring stereotypes about African Americans.

But Mia carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community. When old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town--and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs.

['Ottessa Moshfegh'],Fiction,"Entertainment Weekly's #1 Book of 2018 A New York Times Notable Book and Times Critics' Top Books of 2018 The New York Times bestseller. From one of our boldest, most celebrated new literary voices, a novel about a young woman's efforts to duck the ills of the world by embarking on an extended hibernation with the help of one of the worst psychiatrists in the annals of literature and the battery of medicines she prescribes. Our narrator should be happy, shouldn't she? She's young, thin, pretty, a recent Columbia graduate, works an easy job at a hip art gallery, lives in an apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan paid for, like the rest of her needs, by her inheritance. But there is a dark and vacuous hole in her heart, and it isn't just the loss of her parents, or the way her Wall Street boyfriend treats her, or her sadomasochistic relationship with her best friend, Reva. It's the year 2000 in a city aglitter with wealth and possibility; what could be so terribly wrong? My Year of Rest and Relaxation is a powerful answer to that question. Through the story of a year spent under the influence of a truly mad combination of drugs designed to heal our heroine from her alienation from this world, Moshfegh shows us how reasonable, even necessary, alienation can be. Both tender and blackly funny, merciless and compassionate, it is a showcase for the gifts of one of our major writers working at the height of her powers.

A little more than twenty years later, in autumn 1941, he directed his dynamic forces against the Soviet Union, and in December, the Germans were at the gates of Moscow and Leningrad. At that moment, Hitler appeared--however briefly--to be the most powerful ruler on the planet. Given this dramatic turn of events, it is little wonder that since 1945 generations of historians keep trying to explain how it all happened. This richly illustrated history provides a readable and fresh approach to the complex history of the Third Reich, from the coming to power of the Nazis in 1933 to the final collapse in 1945. Using photographs, paintings, propaganda images, and a host of other such materials from a wide range of sources, including official documents, cinema, and the photography of contemporary amateurs, foreigners, and the Allied armies, it distills our ideas about the period and provides a balanced and accessible account of the whole era.",sT5MDwAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sT5MDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780198728283,en,400, ,Oxford University Press,"{'ratings_count': 12, 'reviews_count': 54, 'text_reviews_count': 3, 'average_rating': '3.67', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '2', '4-stars': '5', '3-stars': '4', '2-stars': '1', '1-star': '0'}}",war,The Oxford Illustrated History of the Third Reich,12,54,3,3.67

"['Christina Snyder', 'Thomas and Kathryn Miller Associate Professor of History Christina Snyder']", ,"In Great Crossings: Indians, Settlers, and Slaves in the Age of Jackson, prize-winning historian Christina Snyder reinterprets the history of Jacksonian America. Most often, this drama focuses on whites who turned west to conquer a continent, extending ""liberty"" as they went. Great Crossings also includes Native Americans from across the continent seeking new ways to assert anciently-held rights and people of African descent who challenged the United States to live up to its ideals. These diverse groups met in an experimental community in central Kentucky called Great Crossings, home to the first federal Indian school and a famous interracial family. Great Crossings embodied monumental changes then transforming North America. The United States, within the span of a few decades, grew from an East Coast nation to a continental empire. The territorial growth of the United States forged a multicultural, multiracial society, but that diversity also sparked fierce debates over race, citizenship, and America's destiny. Great Crossings, a place of race-mixing and cultural exchange, emerged as a battleground. Its history provides an intimate view of the ambitions and struggles of Indians, settlers, and slaves who were trying to secure their place in a changing world. Through deep research and compelling prose, Snyder introduces us to a diverse range of historical actors: Richard Mentor Johnson, the politician who reportedly killed Tecumseh and then became schoolmaster to the sons of his former foes; Julia Chinn, Johnson's enslaved concubine, who fought for her children's freedom; and Peter Pitchlynn, a Choctaw intellectual who, even in the darkest days of Indian removal, argued for the future of Indian nations. Together, their stories demonstrate how this era transformed colonizers and the colonized alike, sowing the seeds of modern America.",9FrjDQAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9FrjDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780199399062,en,416, ,Oxford University Press,"{'ratings_count': 24, 'reviews_count': 112, 'text_reviews_count': 5, 'average_rating': '4.04', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '7', '4-stars': '12', '3-stars': '4', '2-stars': '1', '1-star': '0'}}",history,Great Crossings,24,112,5,4.04

Understanding the past is crucial for improving the future, and Patricia Fara examines how inherited prejudicescontinue to limit women's scientific opportunities.Suffragists aligned themselves with scientific and technological progress. Defying arguments about intellectual inferiority and child-bearing responsibilities, during the War they won support by mobilising women to enter conventionally male domains, including science, industry, medicine, and themilitary. A Lab of One's Own reveals these women's stories, celebrating successes and analysing setbacks. In 1919, the suffragist Millicent Fawcett declared triumphantly that ""The war revolutionised the industrial position of women. It found them serfs, and left them free."" She was wrong: although women hadhelped the country to victory and won the vote for those over thirty, they had lost the battle for equality.

Featuring James Dean, Rock Hudson, and Elizabeth Taylor, Giant is an epic film of fame and materialism, based around the discovery of oil at Spindletop and the establishment of the King Ranch of south Texas. Isolating his star cast in the wilds of West Texas, director George Stevens brought together a volatile mix of egos, insecurities, sexual proclivities, and talent. Stevens knew he was overwhelmed with Hudson’s promiscuity, Taylor’s high diva-dom, and Dean’s egotistical eccentricity. Yet he coaxed performances out of them that made cinematic history, winning Stevens the Academy Award for Best Director and garnering nine other nominations, including a nomination for Best Actor for James Dean, who died before the film was finished. In this compelling and impeccably researched narrative history of the making of the film, Don Graham chronicles the stories of Stevens, whose trauma in World War II intensified his ambition to make films that would tell the story of America; Edna Ferber, a considerable literary celebrity, who meets her match in the imposing Robert Kleberg, proprietor of the vast King Ranch; and Glenn McCarthy, an American oil tycoon; and Errol Flynn lookalike with a taste for Hollywood.

Even before they joined forces, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II had written dozens of Broadway shows, but together they pioneered a new art form: the serious musical play. Their songs and dance numbers served to advance the drama and reveal character, a sharp break from the past and the template on which all future musicals would be built. Though different in personality and often emotionally distant from each other, Rodgers and Hammerstein presented an unbroken front to the world and forged much more than a songwriting team; their partnership was also one of the most profitable and powerful entertainment businesses of their era. They were cultural powerhouses whose work came to define postwar America on stage, screen, television, and radio. But they also had their failures and flops, and more than once they feared they had lost their touch. Todd S.

When asked simple questions about global trends—what percentage of the world’s population live in poverty; why the world’s population is increasing; how many girls finish school—we systematically get the answers wrong. So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess teachers, journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers. In Factfulness, Professor of International Health and global TED phenomenon Hans Rosling, together with his two long-time collaborators, Anna and Ola, offers a radical new explanation of why this happens. They reveal the ten instincts that distort our perspective—from our tendency to divide the world into two camps (usually some version of us and them) to the way we consume media (where fear rules) to how we perceive progress (believing that most things are getting worse). Our problem is that we don’t know what we don’t know, and even our guesses are informed by unconscious and predictable biases. It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think. That doesn’t mean there aren’t real concerns. But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most. Inspiring and revelatory, filled with lively anecdotes and moving stories, Factfulness is an urgent and essential book that will change the way you see the world and empower you to respond to the crises and opportunities of the future. --- “This book is my last battle in my life-long mission to fight devastating ignorance...Previously I armed myself with huge data sets, eye-opening software, an energetic learning style and a Swedish bayonet for sword-swallowing.

['Nelson Mandela'],Biography & Autobiography,"The first, and only, authorized and authenticated collection of correspondence spanning the 27 years Nelson Mandela was held as a political prisoner. While incarcerated in South Africa in four prisons as a sentenced prisoner between 1962 and 1990, Mandela wrote hundreds of letters to loved ones, followers, prison authorities, and government officials documenting his plight as the most prominent political prisoner of the twentieth century. Here, the letters--many of them never before seen by the public--have been assembled from the collections held by the Nelson Mandela Foundation, the South African National Archives, and the Mandela family, amongst others, together with a foreword by Zamaswazi Dlamini-Mandela, granddaughter of Nelson Mandela. With accompanying facsimiles of some of the actual letters with generous annotations, the book provides a personal and intimate portrait of the lawyer and political activist as husband, parent, friend, and political prisoner, reflecting on everything from the trajectory of the anti-apartheid movement to the death of his beloved son, Thembi, in Cape Town in 1969. Quietly impassioned and (despite occasional heavy censorship) eloquent, they reveal both the extraordinary compassion of a father and the unbending will of a man who refused to compromise his ethical values in the face of the most extraordinary human punishment and psychological abuse. The volume covers every aspect of life behind bars for the future South African leader, whose voice the apartheid government attempted to stifle at every possible opportunity.

['Elizabeth Currid-halkett'],Social Science,"In today's world, the leisure class has been replaced by a new elite. Highly educated and defined by cultural capital rather than income bracket, these individuals earnestly buy organic, carry NPR tote bags, and breast-feed their babies. They care about discreet, inconspicuous consumption--like eating free-range chicken and heirloom tomatoes, wearing organic cotton shirts and TOMS shoes, and listening to the Serial podcast. They use their purchasing power to hire nannies and housekeepers, to cultivate their children's growth, and to practice yoga and Pilates. In The Sum of Small Things, Elizabeth Currid-Halkett dubs this segment of society ""the Aspirational Class"" and discusses how, through deft decisions about education, health, parenting, and retirement, the Aspirational Class reproduces wealth and upward mobility, deepening the ever-wider class divide. Exploring the rise of the Aspirational Class, Currid-Halkett considers how much has changed since the 1899 publication of Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class. In that inflammatory classic, which coined the phrase ""conspicuous consumption,"" Veblen described upper-class frivolities: men who used walking sticks for show, and women who bought silver flatware despite the effectiveness of cheaper aluminum utensils. Now, Currid-Halkett argues, the power of material goods as symbols of social position has diminished due to their accessibility. As a result, the Aspirational Class has altered its consumer habits away from overt materialism to more subtle expenditures that reveal status and knowledge. And these transformations influence how we all make choices. With a rich narrative and extensive interviews and research, The Sum of Small Things illustrates how cultural capital leads to lifestyle shifts and what this forecasts, not just for the Aspirational Class but for everyone.",4C5_vgAACAAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4C5_vgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0691162735,en,272, , ,"{'ratings_count': 658, 'reviews_count': 3843, 'text_reviews_count': 88, 'average_rating': '3.65', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '121', '4-stars': '258', '3-stars': '218', '2-stars': '49', '1-star': '12'}}",history,The Sum of Small Things,658,3843,88,3.65

['Gregg Braden'],"BODY, MIND & SPIRIT","Human by Design invites you on a journey beyond Darwin's theory of evolution, beginning with the fact that we exist as we do, even more empowered, and more connected with ourselves and the world, than scientists have believed possible. In one of the great ironies of the modern world, the science that was expected to solve life's mysteries has done just the opposite. New discoveries have led to more unanswered questions, created deeper mysteries, and brought us to the brink of forbidden territory when it comes to explaining our origin and existence. These discoveries reveal the following facts: - Fact 1. Our origin-Modern humans appeared suddenly on earth approximately 200,000 years ago, with the advanced brain, nervous system, and capabilities that set them apart from all other known forms of life already developed, rather than having developed slowly and gradually over a long period of time. - Fact 2. Missing physical evidence-The relationships shown on the conventional tree of human evolution are speculative connections only. While they are believed to exist, a 150-year search has failed to produce the physical evidence that confirms the relationships shown on the evolutionary family tree. - Fact 3. New DNA evidence-The comparison of DNA between ancient Neanderthals, previously thought to be our ancestors, and early humans tells us that we did not descend from the Neanderthals. - Fact 4. A rare DNA fusion-Advanced genome analysis reveals that the DNA that sets us apart from other primates, including in our advanced brain and nervous system, is the result of an ancient and precise fusion of genes occurring in a way that suggests something beyond evolution made our humanness possible. - Fact 5. Our extraordinary abilities-We are born with the capacity to self-heal, to self-regulate longevity, to activate an enhanced immune response, and to experience deep intuition, sympathy, empathy, and, ultimately, compassion-and to do each of these on demand. In this book, New York Times best-selling author and 2017 Templeton Award nominee Gregg Braden crosses the traditional boundaries of science and spirituality to answer the timeless question at the core of our existence-Who are we?-and to reveal science-based techniques that awaken our uniquely human experiences of deep intuition, precognition, advanced states of self-healing, and much more!

['Frederic Wehrey'],History,"A riveting, beautifully crafted account of Libya after Qadhafi. The death of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi freed Libya from forty-two years of despotic rule, raising hopes for a new era. But in the aftermath, the country descended into bitter rivalries and civil war, paving the way for the Islamic State and a catastrophic migrant crisis. In a fast-paced narrative that blends frontline reporting, analysis, and history, Frederic Wehrey tells the story of what went wrong. An Arabic-speaking Middle East scholar, Wehrey interviewed the key actors in Libya and paints vivid portraits of lives upended by a country in turmoil: the once-hopeful activists murdered or exiled, revolutionaries transformed into militia bosses or jihadist recruits, an aging general who promises salvation from the chaos in exchange for a return to the old authoritarianism.

They are now joined by a new geological force—humans. Our actions have driven Earth into a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. For the first time in our home planet's 4.5-billion-year history a single species is increasingly dictating Earth's future. To some the Anthropocene symbolizes a future of superlative control of our environment. To others it is the height of hubris, the illusion of our mastery over nature. Whatever your view, just below the surface of this odd-sounding scientific word, the Anthropocene, is a heady mix of science, philosophy, and politics linked to our deepest fears and utopian visions.

"['Wim Hof', 'Koen De Jong']",Health & Fitness,"Science has now proved that the legendary Wim Hof Method of breath control and cold-training can dramatically enhance energy levels, improve circulation, reduce stress, boost the immune system, strengthen the body and successfully combat many diseases. While Wim Hof himself has run marathons in -30 C in shorts, swum hundreds of meters under the ice, sat in a tank of ice for 90 minutes without his core temperature changing and boosted his metabolism by over 300%, The Way of The Iceman documents how anyone can use Wim's methods to transform their health and strength, quickly and safely. -After teaching specialized breathing techniques to SEALs for years, helping them focus, stay warm in the cold ocean and get centered in combat, I can attest to the authenticity and power of Wim Hof's methods. Wim Hof is providing a great service with his new book The Way of The Iceman by bringing breath training and simple, powerful health practices into mainstream consciousness.- --Mark Divine, US Navy SEAL (ret), Founder SEALFIT, Best selling author of Unbeatable Mind and Way of the SEAL ‪ -I am continuously searching for ways to expand my mind, body and spirit--Wim Hof and The Way of The Iceman have done just that! He shows us that human potential is limitless and we are ALL capable of anything we set our minds to.- ‪--Lewis Howes, New York Times bestselling author of The School of Greatness -What fascinates me most about Wim Hof's method is the potential application for athletes...the science in this book shows that we can all amplify our recovery, maximize our pain tolerance, massively jack up energy levels and even learn to control inflammation...and it can be done without resorting to toxic drugs. In fact, the system outlined in this manual might just be the key to producing a generation of enhanced but drug-free athletes.- ‪--Paul -Coach- Wade, author of Convict Conditioning -Inspiration inspires. What I like most about Wim and his book is how he taught me to trust my body, overcome fear and give me the best opportunity for success. He mixes personal experience and science--which becomes truly motivating. Wim provides the tools you need to master self-discipline, gain courage and live a vibrant life. He is Aquaman and Tony Robbins rolled into one. He is The Iceman!- --Jesse Itzler, author of Living With A SEAL -Homo sapiens is a species that is uniquely and tragically ill-adapted to our environment. Maladies ranging from heart disease to diabetes to autoimmune disorders are generated by the mismatch between the natural world we evolved to live in and the artificial realms in which we find ourselves today. Wim Hof's teachings show us how to recalibrate our bodies in a way that recognizes the extremes of our natural environment as teachers to be celebrated and consulted, rather than enemies to be insulated against. Wim's deepest insights resonate with our hunter-gatherer ancestors, who understood the wisdom of adapting to the natural world rather than trying to dominate and control it.- --Christopher Ryan, PhD., New York Times best-selling author of Sex at Dawn -We live in a chaotic modern world with daily assaults on our health from frenetic schedules, poor sleep, high stress, chronic disease, and infectious illness. Our brain and nervous system have been highjacked by this toxic environment, always on high alert with real consequences to our physical and mental health. With The Way of The Iceman, Wim Hof has given a profound gift to public health. The science is solid and the results actual and measureable. As you follow his remarkable life story it is readily apparent that this man is no charlatan or snake oil salesman. Through years of commitment and self-experimentation, Wim has empirically figured out how to exert significant control over the autonomic nervous system, a feat once thought impossible. His method has held up to scrutiny under the dispassionate lens of science, expanding our knowledge of what is possible with dedicated training in what is now known as the Wim Hof Method. Deceptively simple, and incredibly powerful, The Way of the Iceman gives you not only the scientific framework, but actionable steps you can implement to take back control over your high-jacked brain, increase resilience from illness, and start healing yourself from the inside out. The Wim Hof Method has become a cornerstone in my personal daily wellness plan, and as a public health physician, I cannot recommend it highly enough.- --Dr. Chris Hardy, D.O. MPH, CSCS, Public Health Physician, Integrative Medicine Specialist -The Way of The Iceman is one of only two books in my life that I have read cover to cover the first time I put my hands on it. What won me over was the simplicity of the explanations of diabetes, inflammation and the family of modern ills. Moreover, the discussion on diet, just a brief mention of 'Fast-Five, ' is the first time I actually understood not only how inflammation is such an issue, but a means to deal with it. This book is the missing link for most of us: the discussion of breathing is so simple, yet so doable; coaches and athletes will understand a newer and simpler means of recovery. Nothing in the book is over the top and we are talking about a guy who swims under ice. The method is so simple, yet so elegant. It's marvelous and I think you will apply the techniques immediately.- --Daniel John, author of Never Let Go -Wim Hof has learned to control his physiology in a way rarely seen in human history. This book takes his extraordinary techniques and simplifies them so you can optimize your health and wellness. I recommend you learn the unique methods Wim has mastered in order to add vitality to your body and life.- --Chad Waterbury, neurophysiologist, author The Muscle Revolution -I found The Way of The Iceman absolutely fascinating! Many of us are familiar with the numerous benefits of cold training, such as increased energy levels, better circulation and improved mood, but nothing on the subject has ever been presented of this magnitude before! The legend himself, Wim Hof, along with Koen De Jong, share not only a detailed account of Mr. Hof's lifetime achievements (such as running a marathon in the Arctic... in just a pair of shorts!), but also practical, actionable methods that anyone can employ. This book has everything from progressive cold submersion methods to breathing techniques. It delves into meditation and spirituality, but also presents the hard science to back it up. Any fan of physical culture or anybody curious about how far the human limits can be pushed needs to add this to their library.- --Danny Kavadlo, author of Strength Rules -Wim Hof's techniques healed my gut where nothing else would. And I tried everything. The Way of The Iceman should be required reading. The world is just beginning to realize the extraordinary gift we have in Wim Hof.- --Mark Joyner, founder of Simpleology -As someone who enjoys bare-chested, outdoor winter calisthenics workouts, Wim Hof's extreme cold weather feats immediately appealed to me. The Wim Hof Method is so simple that anyone can get started right away. And the results are so palpable that once you start, you'll almost certainly want to keep going.- --Al Kavadlo, author of Street Workout and Pushing The Limits! -Wim Hof first came across my radar a few years ago when I heard of a crazy Dutchman defying the laws of thermodynamics. How could a man submerge himself in freezing water for prolonged periods of time without hypothermia? How was it possible for his body temperature to stay the same during the process? This book is an enlightening look into the nervous system, and the amazing power of the mind. Don't mistake this for simple 'cold therapy' although that is a piece of the puzzle. This book will give you a front row seat to an education on the nervous system, and how one man and his disciples have learned to control it in a way that we previously thought was impossible. I found The Way of The Iceman fascinating.- --Max Shank, founder of Ultimate Athleticism and author of Master The Kettlebell When I read The Way of The Iceman I was struck with awe and hope! Wim has brought scientific evidence to what I personally believe and have been teaching my students for years about breathing, bioenergetics and our connection to the spirit world. By demystifying the religious Wim is helping to support a Truth in the New World; mainly that spirituality without science descends into superstition, and science without spirituality degrades humanity into the meaninglessness of materialism.- --Elliott Hulse -Wim Hof makes the seemingly mystical and extraordinary, ridiculously easy to access. Anyone who is willing to explore the latent powers of deep breathing and imagination will feast upon his unique story and his method of overpowering the unconquerable elements of nature.---Matt Furey, author of Combat Conditioning -What lies within this book is the key to accessing power whenever and wherever on demand.

['Freeman Dyson'],Biography & Autobiography,"Having penned hundreds of letters to his family over four decades, Freeman Dyson has framed them with the reflections made by a man now in his nineties. While maintaining that ""the letters record the daily life of an ordinary scientist doing ordinary work,"" Dyson nonetheless has worked with many of the twentieth century's most renowned physicists, mathematicians, and intellectuals, so that Maker of Patterns presents not only his personal story but chronicles through firsthand accounts an exciting era of twentieth-century science. Though begun in the dark year of 1941 when Hitler's armies had already conquered much of Europe, Dyson's letters to his parents, written at Trinity College, Cambridge, often burst with the curiosity of a precocious seventeen-year-old. Pursuing mathematics and physics with a cast of legendary professors, Dyson thrived in Cambridge's intellectual ferment, working on, for example, the theory of partitions or reading about Kurt Gödel's hypotheses, while still finding time for billiards and mountain climbing. After graduating and serving with the Royal Air Force's Bomber Command operational research section, whose job it was ""to demolish German cities and kill as many German civilians as possible,"" Dyson visited a war-torn Germany, hoping through his experience to create a ""tolerably peaceful world."" Juxtaposing descriptions of scientific breakthroughs with concerns for mankind's future, Dyson's postwar letters reflect the quandaries faced by an entire scientific generation that was dealing with the aftereffects of nuclear detonations and concentration camp killings. Arriving in America in 1947 to study with Cornell's Hans Bethe, Dyson continued to send weekly missives to England that were never technical but written with grace and candor, creating a portrait of a generation that was eager, as Einstein once stated, to solve ""deep mysteries that Nature intend[ed] to keep for herself."" We meet, among others, scientists like Richard Feynman, who took Dyson across country on Route 66, Robert Oppenheimer, Eugene Wigner, Niels Bohr, James Watson, and a young Stephen Hawking; and we encounter intellectuals and leaders, among them Reinhold Niebuhr, George Kennan, Arthur C. Clarke, as well as Martin Luther King, Jr. The ""patterns of comparable beauty in the dance of electrons jumping around atoms"" invariably replicate themselves in this autobiography told through letters, one that combines accounts of wanton arms development with the not-inconsiderable demands of raising six children. As we once again attempt to guide society toward a more hopeful future, these letters, with their reenactment of what, at first, seems like a distant past, reveal invaluable truths about human nature.",p6e0tAEACAAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p6e0tAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0871403862,en,416, , ,"{'ratings_count': 97, 'reviews_count': 1064, 'text_reviews_count': 20, 'average_rating': '4.34', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '46', '4-stars': '40', '3-stars': '9', '2-stars': '2', '1-star': '0'}}",science,Maker of Patterns,97,1064,20,4.34

['Akiko Busch'],Art,"""Vivid, surprising, and utterly timely, Akiko Busch's How to disappear explores the idea of invisibility in nature, art, and science, in search of a more joyful and peaceful way of living in today's increasingly surveilled and publicity-obsessed world In our increasingly networked and image-saturated lives, the notion of disappearing has never been both more enchanting and yet fanciful. Today, we are relentlessly encouraged, even conditioned, to reveal, share, and self-promote. The pressure to be public comes not just from our peers, but vast and pervasive technology companies, which want to profit from patterns in our behavior. A lifelong student and observer of the natural world, Busch sets out to explore her own uneasiness with this arrangement, and what she senses is a widespread desire for a less scrutinized way of life--for invisibility. Writing in rich painterly detail about her own life, her family, and some of the world's most exotic and remote places--from the Cayman Islands to Iceland--she savors the pleasures of being unseen. Discovering and dramatizing a wonderful range of ways of disappearing, from virtual reality goggles that trick the wearer into believing her body has disappeared and to the way Virginia Woolf's fictional Mrs. Dalloway feels a flickering of personhood as an older woman, Busch deliberates on subjects new and old with equal sensitivity and incisiveness.

['Rebecca Erbelding'],History,"America has long been criticized for refusing to give harbor to the Jews of Europe as Hitler and the Nazis closed in. Now a U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum scholar tells the extraordinary story of the War Refugee Board, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's little-known effort late in the war to save the Jews who remained. In January 1944, a young Treasury lawyer named John Pehle accompanied his boss to a meeting with the president. For more than a decade, the Jews of Germany had sought refuge in the United States and had been stymied by Congress's harsh immigration policy. Now the State Department was refusing to authorize relief funds Pehle wanted to use to help Jews escape Nazi territory. At the meeting, Pehle made his best case--and prevailed. Within days, FDR created the War Refugee Board, empowering it to rescue the victims of Nazi persecution, and put John Pehle in charge. Over the next twenty months, Pehle pulled together a team of D.C. pencil pushers, international relief workers, smugglers, diplomats, millionaires, and rabble-rousers to run operations across four continents and a dozen countries. Together, they tricked the Nazis, forged identity papers, maneuvered food and medicine into concentration camps, recruited spies, leaked news stories, laundered money, negotiated ransoms, and funneled millions of dollars into Europe. They bought weapons for the French Resistance and sliced red tape to allow Jewish refugees to escape to Palestine. Altogether, they saved tens of thousands of lives. For Rescue Board, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum scholar Rebecca Erbelding undertook a decade of research and uncovered new archival materials to tell the dramatic unknown story of America's last-ditch effort to save the Jews of Europe.",T6xFswEACAAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T6xFswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0385542518,en,384, ,Doubleday Books,"{'ratings_count': 83, 'reviews_count': 1569, 'text_reviews_count': 19, 'average_rating': '3.81', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '28', '4-stars': '23', '3-stars': '25', '2-stars': '2', '1-star': '5'}}",history,Rescue Board,83,1569,19,3.81

['Phoebe Maltz Bovy'],Social Science,"Privilege—the word, the idea, the j’accuse that cannot be answered with equanimity—is the new rhetorical power play. From social media to academia, public speech to casual conversation, “Check your privilege” or “Your privilege is showing” are utilized to brand people of all kinds with a term once reserved for wealthy, old-money denizens of exclusive communities. Today, “privileged” applies to anyone who enjoys an unearned advantage in life, about which they are likely oblivious. White privilege, male privilege, straight privilege—those conditions make everyday life easier, less stressful, more lucrative, and generally better for those who hold one, two, or all three designations. But what about white female privilege in the context of feminism? Or fixed gender privilege in the context of transgender? Or weight and height privilege in the context of hiring practices and salary levels? Or food privilege in the context of public health? Or two parent, working class privilege in the context of widening inequality for single parent families? In The Perils of Privilege, Phoebe Maltz Bovy examines the rise of this word into extraordinary potency. Does calling out privilege help to change or soften it?

In Ibsen's play, Nora Helmer has secretly (and deceptively) borrowed a large sum of money to pay for her husband, Torvald, to recover from illness on a sabbatical in Italy. Torvald's perception of Nora is of a silly, naive spendthrift, so it is only when the truth begins to emerge, and Torvald appreciates the initiative behind his wife, that unmendable cracks appear in their marriage.

['Mark Anderson'],Literary Criticism,"The debate over the true author of the Shakespeare canon has raged for centuries. Astonishingly little evidence supports the traditional belief that Will Shakespeare, the actor and businessman from Stratford-upon-Avon, was the author. Legendary figures such as Mark Twain, Walt Whitman and Sigmund Freud have all expressed grave doubts that an uneducated man who apparently owned no books and never left England wrote plays and poems that consistently reflect a learned and well-traveled insider's perspective on royal courts and the ancient feudal nobility. Recent scholarship has turned to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford-an Elizabethan court playwright known to have written in secret and who had ample means, motive and opportunity to in fact have assumed the ""Shakespeare"" disguise. ""Shakespeare"" by Another Name is the literary biography of Edward de Vere as ""Shakespeare."" This groundbreaking book tells the story of de Vere's action-packed life-as Renaissance man, spendthrift, courtier, wit, student, scoundrel, patron, military adventurer, and, above all, prolific ghostwriter-finding in it the background material for all of The Bard's works. Biographer Mark Anderson incorporates a wealth of new evidence, including de Vere's personal copy of the Bible (in which de Vere underlines scores of passages that are also prominent Shakespearean biblical references).",kzav7JrRRJsC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kzav7JrRRJsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9781611871784,en,667, ,Untreed Reads,"{'ratings_count': 475, 'reviews_count': 1112, 'text_reviews_count': 96, 'average_rating': '3.97', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '190', '4-stars': '155', '3-stars': '79', '2-stars': '27', '1-star': '24'}}",history,Shakespeare by Another Name,475,1112,96,3.97

At the heart of that transformation was the controversial emergence of an illegitimate theatre, and a cultural struggle between London's patent playhouses (Drury Lane, Covent Garden and the Haymarket) and the new, so-called minor theatres. This was the first book to explore the institutions, genres, and performance history of this illegitimate theatre. Jane Moody's lively account considers the prohibition of tragedy and comedy at London's minor theatres and describes the various ingenious ways in which performers circumnavigated the law. Moody brings to light illicit productions of Shakespeare and the minor theatres' fascination with dramatic subjects censored on the legitimate stage.

In this love comedy, Lyly retells an ancient legend of the prolonged sleep of the man with whom the moon (Cynthia) fell in love. The fable is piquantly relevant to Queen Elizabeth and her exasperated if adoring courtiers. This edition makes a new and compelling argument for the relevance of Endymion to the threat of the Spanish Armada invasion of 1588 and to the role of the Earl of Oxford in England’s politics of that troubled decade.

Not only is the influence of Greek drama palpable in everything from Shakespeare to modern television, the insights contained in Greek tragedy have shaped our perceptions of the nature of human life. Poets, philosophers, and politicians have long borrowed and adapted the ideas and language of Greek drama to help them make sense of their own times. This exciting curated anthology features a cross section of the most popular—and most widely taught—plays in the Greek canon. Fresh translations into contemporary English breathe new life into the texts while capturing, as faithfully as possible, their original meaning. This outstanding collection also offers short biographies of the playwrights, enlightening and clarifying introductions to the plays, and helpful annotations at the bottom of each page. Appendices by prominent classicists on such topics as “Greek Drama and Politics,” “The Theater of Dionysus,” and “Plato and Aristotle on Tragedy” give the reader a rich contextual background. A detailed time line of the dramas, as well as a list of adaptations of Greek drama to literature, stage, and film from the time of Seneca to the present, helps chart the history of Greek tragedy and illustrate its influence on our culture from the Roman Empire to the present day. With a veritable who’s who of today’s most renowned and distinguished classical translators, The Greek Plays is certain to be the definitive text for students, scholars, theatrical professionals, and general readers alike for years to come. Praise for The Greek Plays “Mary Lefkowitz and James Romm deftly have gathered strong new translations from Frank Nisetich, Sarah Ruden, Rachel Kitzinger, Emily Wilson, as well as from Mary Lefkowitz and James Romm themselves. There is a freshness and pungency in these new translations that should last a long time. I admire also the introductions to the plays and the biographies and annotations provided. Closing essays by five distinguished classicists: the brilliant Daniel Mendelsohn and the equally skilled David Rosenbloom, Joshua Billings, Mary-Kay Gamel, and Gregory Hays all enlightened me. This seems to me a helpful light into our gathering darkness.”—Harold Bloom “The reception of Ancient Greek theater is as lively as it’s ever been in its 2,500-year history, both on the stage and on the page.

['René Girard'],Drama,"In this groundbreaking work a foremost literary and cultural critic turns to the major figure in English literature William Shakespeare and proposes a dramatic new way of reading and performing his works. The key to A Theatre of Envy is Rene Girards's original expression and application of what he calls Mimetic Theory. For Girard, people desire according to the desires of others. He sees this as fundamental to the human condition and works out its implications in a most convincing and ultimately, easily comprehensible way. Bringing his insights to bear on Shakespeare, Girard reveals the previously overlooked coherence of problem plays like Troilus and Cressida and makes a convincing argument for elevating A Midsummer Night's Dream from the status of entertaining chaotic comedy to a profound and original commentary on the human condition. Shakespeare transforms the crude literary form of revenge tragedy into a profound and prophetic unmasking of violence - even more relevant today than in his time. Throughout this impressively sustained reading of Shakespeare, Girard's prose is sophisticated enough for the academic as well as being accessible to the general reader. Anyone interested in literature, anthropology, psychology and particularly, theology as relevant to the overriding contemporary problems of violence in all its forms will want to read this challenging book. All those involved in theatrical productions and performance will find A Theatre of Envy full of exciting and practical ideas. 'In its enormous breathtaking scope, (Rene Girard's work) suggests...the projects of those 19th century intellectual giants (Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche and Freud) who still cast such long shadows today. By contrast, contemporary criticism seems paltry and fainthearted.' Comparative Literature Rene Girard was born in Avignon, read cultural history in Paris and in 1947 went to the USA where he has for the last 50 years held a number of prestigious academic posts. He has written more than half a dozen books, best known of which are, Violence and the Sacred, The Scapegoat, and Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World, he has also been featured in many interviews and magazine articles. His Martin D'Arcy Lecture - ""Victims, Violence and Christianity"" - delivered in Oxford in November 1997, aroused the enthusiastic interest of a wide variety of British experts in many fields as well as those involved in the wider and increasingly significant world of contemporary spirituality in all its popular and peremptory expressions. While not giving a naive answer Rene Girard does provide a profound and practical way to unmask violence not only in Shakespeare's world, but in our own.",N3LSBpZ6KS8C,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N3LSBpZ6KS8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0852445105,en,384, ,Gracewing Publishing,"{'ratings_count': 131, 'reviews_count': 787, 'text_reviews_count': 18, 'average_rating': '4.30', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '69', '4-stars': '37', '3-stars': '21', '2-stars': '3', '1-star': '1'}}",philosophy,A Theatre of Envy,131,787,18,4.30

['Aristophanes'],Drama,"If the American Editor of this little volume (which is sent forth as a test of the character of American learning) deemed it either expedient or necessary to expatiate upon the merits of an author so celebrated and gifted as A ristophanes, he might extend his eulogia beyond the patient perusal of the moderns. The eloquent and erudite preliminary discourse by the accomplished translator, however, anticipates the remarks which otherwise would be expanded. No satirist, ancient or modern, ever enjoyed the deserved reputation of A ristophanes, and no one ever depicted, in colors so vivid and unfading, the essential and peculiar characteristics of democracy. As he lived under the dominion of the Universal People, he thoroughly understood the qualities of the democrats whom he has ridiculed and immortalized; and he never shrunk, when occasion demanded, from the exposure of flagrant abuses. Therefore, we commend, earnestly commend the perusal of this volume to our literary countrymen: and if the reception of this limited edition of a single comedy shall justify the editor in the more enlarged republication of all the works of A ristophanes, he will rejoice in the opportunity, thus afforded, of instructing and enlightening his countrymen.",RCLsAgAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RCLsAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9781625580825,en,39, ,Simon and Schuster,"{'ratings_count': 367, 'reviews_count': 715, 'text_reviews_count': 24, 'average_rating': '3.53', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '71', '4-stars': '112', '3-stars': '133', '2-stars': '44', '1-star': '7'}}",literature,The Knights,367,715,24,3.53

['J. L. Styan'],Drama,"For many years, critics and students of Shakespeare have tended to stress that his plays are poetic structures embodying 'themes', and these structures have been analysed in great detail. Professor Styan advocates another approach. The plays were written for acting, in a theatre of a particular type. If we ask what effects this kind of theatre encouraged and how Shakespeare exploited them, the plays are seen as a sequence of stage-effects, planned with great art so as to enrich, reinforce and modify each other. Professor Styan begins with the known facts about the Elizabethan theatre, stressing the effect of the size of the apron stage, and the degree in which the spectators situated all around are involved in the action. It was a theatre of movement and grouping, and above all speech. Shakespeare's verse is full of suggestions about how it is to be delivered; it is, in Professor Styan's word, 'gestic'. Professor Styan shows in very many examples, quoting the text and examining its dramatic implications, what the words suggest about movement over the stage, about the relationship between groups of players on the stage, and about the delivery and dramatic effect of the words themselves. Thus we build up a new sense of the whole play. This is a convenient and comprehensive introduction to the study of Shakespeare's dramatic craftsmanship, which also reopens that direction of enquiry which Granville-Barker first explored.",NkYsNNG2insC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NkYsNNG2insC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0521094356,en,256, ,Cambridge University Press,"{'ratings_count': 15, 'reviews_count': 43, 'text_reviews_count': 4, 'average_rating': '4.00', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '2', '4-stars': '11', '3-stars': '2', '2-stars': '0', '1-star': '0'}}",resources,Shakespeare's Stagecraft,15,43,4,4.00

['Christopher Murray'],Drama,"The Irish Dramatic Movement gave to the world major playwrights such as Yeats, Synge, Lady Gregory, O'Casey and Beckett, while in more recent times the international stage has come to appreciate the talents of a new generation of Irish playwrights, including Brian Friel, Sebastian Barry, and Marina Carr. Preoccupied with questions of identity and national self-realization, the theater assumed a more critical, analytic, and demythologizing role in society after independence in 1922. Irish drama owes its imaginative power to its energetic involvement with cultural transformations and to more acceptable modes of representation and critique. Twentieth Century Irish Drama provides a perfect overview of a nation's theater read in light of a nation's struggle toward self-definition.

In 2009, the same property is being bought by a young white couple, whose plan to raze the house and start again is met with equal disapproval by the black residents of the soon-to-be-gentrified area.

It is as if we all got together in private and said whatever you do don't mention that, like it never happened. It's the late 1940s. Calm has returned to London and five people are recovering from the chaos of war. In scenes set in a quiet dating agency, a bombed-out church and a prison cell, the stories of these five lives begin to intertwine and we uncover the desire and regret that has bound them together. Sarah Waters's story of illicit love and everyday heroism takes us from a dazed and shattered post-war Britain back into the heart of the Blitz, towards the secrets that are hidden there.

['Helene P. Foley'],Literary Criticism,"Although Classical Athenian ideology did not permit women to exercise legal, economic, and social autonomy, the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides often represent them as influential social and moral forces in their own right. Scholars have struggled to explain this seeming contradiction. Helene Foley shows how Greek tragedy uses gender relations to explore specific issues in the development of the social, political, and intellectual life in the polis. She investigates three central and problematic areas in which tragic heroines act independently of men: death ritual and lamentation, marriage, and the making of significant ethical choices. Her anthropological approach, together with her literary analysis, allows for an unusually rich context in which to understand gender relations in ancient Greece. This book examines, for example, the tragic response to legislation regulating family life that may have begun as early as the sixth century. It also draws upon contemporary studies of virtue ethics and upon feminist reconsiderations of the Western ethical tradition. Foley maintains that by viewing public issues through the lens of the family, tragedy asks whether public and private morality can operate on the same terms. Moreover, the plays use women to represent significant moral alternatives. Tragedy thus exploits, reinforces, and questions cultural clichés about women and gender in a fashion that resonates with contemporary Athenian social and political issues.",HaEN2Dxxv6YC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HaEN2Dxxv6YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,1400824737,en,424, ,Princeton University Press,"{'ratings_count': 21, 'reviews_count': 66, 'text_reviews_count': 1, 'average_rating': '3.81', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '4', '4-stars': '9', '3-stars': '8', '2-stars': '0', '1-star': '0'}}",studies,Female Acts in Greek Tragedy,21,66,1,3.81

Gothic focuses on the various styles and forms of the genre and analyzes the cultural significance of its prevalent figures--the ghosts, monsters, vampires, doubles and horrors that are its definitive features. Botting traces its history from its origins in the 18th century through its modernist and postmodernist representations, highlighting the ways Gothic figures have continued to shadow the progress of modernity, always displaying the underside of human values.

['Slavoj Žižek'],Performing Arts,"Slavoj Zizek, a leading intellectual in the new social movements that are sweepingEastern Europe, provides a virtuoso reading of Jacques Lacan. Zizek inverts current pedagogicalstrategies to explain the difficult philosophical underpinnings of the French theoretician andpractician who revolutionized our view of psychoanalysis. He approaches Lacan through the motifs andworks of contemporary popular culture, from Hitchcock's Vertigo to Stephen King's Pet Sematary, fromMcCullough's An Indecent Obsession to Romero's Return of the Living Dead - a strategy of ""lookingawry"" that recalls the exhilarating and vital experience of Lacan.Zizek discovers fundamentalLacanian categories the triad Imaginary/Symbolic/Real, the object small a, the opposition of driveand desire, the split subject - at work in horror fiction, in detective thrillers, in romances, inthe mass media's perception of ecological crisis, and, above all, in Alfred Hitchcock's films. Theplayfulness of Zizek's text, however, is entirely different from that associated with thedeconstructive approach made famous by Derrida. By clarifying what Lacan is saying as well as whathe is not saying, Zizek is uniquely able to distinguish Lacan from the poststructuralists who sooften claim him.Slavoj Zizek is a Researcher in the Institute of Sociology at the University ofLjubljana, Yugoslavia.

The novelist Amitav Ghosh argues that we need art and literature to help us imagine our future in the Anthropocene, but that they are falling short of the task. If culture cannot help us see the realities of our plight, then our era, which so congratulates itself on its self-awareness, may come to be known as the time of the Great Derangement. A case in point is fiction, which is so committed to normalcy and the everyday that it has no space for the improbability of climate change events the persistent droughts, hundred-year storms, and freakish tornadoes. Our politics, likewise, seems unable to mobilize forcefully in response to climate change. Ghosh argues that politics, like literature, has become a matter of individual moral reckoning, a journey of the solitary conscience rather than an arena of collective action. But to limit fiction and politics to individual moral adventure comes at a great cost. The climate crisis asks us to imagine other forms of human existence a task to which fiction, Ghosh argues, is the best suited of all cultural forms.

The Great Code is culturally allusive to a high degree. It takes much of its inspiration from the Bible itself, including a profusion of biblical passages, but also from the author's extensive reading of a host of other texts from ancient times until the late twentieth century. Lee's extensive annotation illustrates, beyond question, that Frye's knowledge of the Bible and how it has worked in Western culture was at once profound and visionary.

Both witty and immensely erudite, Jacques Rancière leads the critical reader through a maze of arrivals toward the moment, perhaps always suspended, when the word finds its flesh. That is what he, a valiant and good-humored companion to these texts, goes questing for through seven essays examining a wide variety of familiar and unfamiliar works. A text is always a commencement, the word setting out on its excursions through the implausible vicissitudes of narrative and the bizarre phantasmagorias of imagery, Don Quixote's unsent letter reaching us through generous Balzac, lovely Rimbaud, demonic Althusser.

['Peter Achinstein'],Philosophy,"Is there a universal set of rules for discovering and testing scientific hypotheses? Since the birth of modern science, philosophers, scientists, and other thinkers have wrestled with this fundamental question of scientific practice. Efforts to devise rigorous methods for obtaining scientific knowledge include the twenty-one rules Descartes proposed in his Rules for the Direction of the Mind and the four rules of reasoning that begin the third book of Newton's Principia, and continue today in debates over the very possibility of such rules. Bringing together key primary sources spanning almost four centuries, Science Rules introduces readers to scientific methods that have played a prominent role in the history of scientific practice. Editor Peter Achinstein includes works by scientists and philosophers of science to offer a new perspective on the nature of scientific reasoning. For each of the methods discussed, he presents the original formulation of the method; selections written by a proponent of the method together with an application to a particular scientific example; and a critical analysis of the method that draws on historical and contemporary sources. The methods included in this volume are Cartesian rationalism with an application to Descartes' laws of motion; Newton's inductivism and the law of gravity; two versions of hypothetico-deductivism—those of William Whewell and Karl Popper—and the nineteenth-century wave theory of light; Paul Feyerabend's principle of proliferation and Thomas Kuhn's views on scientific values, both of which deny that there are universal rules of method, with an application to Galileo's tower argument. Included also is a famous nineteenth-century debate about scientific reasoning between the hypothetico-deductivist William Whewell and the inductivist John Stuart Mill; and an account of the realism-antirealism dispute about unobservables in science, with a consideration of Perrin's argument for the existence of molecules in the early twentieth century.",pBRUggPuawQC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pBRUggPuawQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0801879434,en,440, ,JHU Press,"{'ratings_count': 6, 'reviews_count': 45, 'text_reviews_count': 0, 'average_rating': '4.17', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '2', '4-stars': '3', '3-stars': '1', '2-stars': '0', '1-star': '0'}}",philosophy,Science Rules,6,45,0,4.17

It appears here together with Mind and Matter, his essay investigating a relationship which has eluded and puzzled philosophers since the earliest times.

A New York Times Bestseller • Goodreads Choice Awards WINNER A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: Smithsonian, NPR Science Friday, The Times (London), Popular Mechanics, Science News, Library Journal, Booklist, and Chicago Public Library ""A masterpiece of science writing."" —Washington Post ""This is scientific storytelling at its most visceral, striding with the beasts through their Triassic dawn, Jurassic dominance, and abrupt demise in the Cretaceous."" —Nature The dinosaurs. Sixty-six million years ago, the Earth’s most fearsome creatures vanished. Today they remain one of our planet’s great mysteries. Now The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs reveals their extraordinary, 200-million-year-long story as never before. In this captivating narrative (enlivened with more than seventy original illustrations and photographs), Steve Brusatte, a young American paleontologist who has emerged as one of the foremost stars of the field—naming fifteen new species and leading groundbreaking scientific studies and fieldwork—masterfully tells the complete, surprising, and new history of the dinosaurs, drawing on cutting-edge science to dramatically bring to life their lost world and illuminate their enigmatic origins, spectacular flourishing, astonishing diversity, cataclysmic extinction, and startling living legacy. Captivating and revelatory, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is a book for the ages. Brusatte traces the evolution of dinosaurs from their inauspicious start as small shadow dwellers—themselves the beneficiaries of a mass extinction caused by volcanic eruptions at the beginning of the Triassic period—into the dominant array of species every wide-eyed child memorizes today, T. rex, Triceratops, Brontosaurus, and more. This gifted scientist and writer re-creates the dinosaurs’ peak during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, when thousands of species thrived, and winged and feathered dinosaurs, the prehistoric ancestors of modern birds, emerged. The story continues to the end of the Cretaceous period, when a giant asteroid or comet struck the planet and nearly every dinosaur species (but not all) died out, in the most extraordinary extinction event in earth’s history, one full of lessons for today as we confront a “sixth extinction.” Brusatte also recalls compelling stories from his globe-trotting expeditions during one of the most exciting eras in dinosaur research—which he calls “a new golden age of discovery”—and offers thrilling accounts of some of the remarkable findings he and his colleagues have made, including primitive human-sized tyrannosaurs; monstrous carnivores even larger than T. rex; and paradigm-shifting feathered raptors from China. An electrifying scientific history that unearths the dinosaurs’ epic saga, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs will be a definitive and treasured account for decades to come.

Now he stands ready to revolutionize both neuroscience and computing in one stroke, with a new understanding of intelligence itself. Hawkins develops a powerful theory of how the human brain works, explaining why computers are not intelligent and how, based on this new theory, we can finally build intelligent machines. The brain is not a computer, but a memory system that stores experiences in a way that reflects the true structure of the world, remembering sequences of events and their nested relationships and making predictions based on those memories. It is this memory-prediction system that forms the basis of intelligence, perception, creativity, and even consciousness. In an engaging style that will captivate audiences from the merely curious to the professional scientist, Hawkins shows how a clear understanding of how the brain works will make it possible for us to build intelligent machines, in silicon, that will exceed our human ability in surprising ways.

This new edition of a bestselling textbook continues to emphasize principles rather than practice, providing the interdisciplinary perspective and grounding required for research. Organized into three sections, the book first describes the molecular structures, properties, and environmental fate of pollutants. It then deals with the effects of pollutants on living organisms at the molecular, cellular, and individual levels. Moving into population biology and population genetics, the third part of the book addresses a question of great interest to ecologists: What effects do pollutants have at the levels of population, community, and the whole ecosystem? The book also looks at how ecotoxicology is used in the biomonitoring of environmental pollution, the investigation of pollution problems, the conducting of field trials, the study of the development of resistance, and the growing area of environmental risk assessments. Throughout, examples and case studies illustrate the principles. This updated fourth edition includes new material on nanoparticle pollution, bioaccumulation, biomarkers, and chemical warfare in nature, as well as a new chapter on the future directions of ecotoxicology. A concise textbook that will also appeal to practicing ecotoxicologists, it provides a solid basis for understanding what happens to chemicals in the real world, where they go, how they ultimately degrade, and how they affect the individuals and populations that encounter them.

['W. Bernard Carlson'],Biography & Autobiography,"Nikola Tesla was a major contributor to the electrical revolution that transformed daily life at the turn of the twentieth century. His inventions, patents, and theoretical work formed the basis of modern AC electricity, and contributed to the development of radio and television. Like his competitor Thomas Edison, Tesla was one of America's first celebrity scientists, enjoying the company of New York high society and dazzling the likes of Mark Twain with his electrical demonstrations. An astute self-promoter and gifted showman, he cultivated a public image of the eccentric genius. Even at the end of his life when he was living in poverty, Tesla still attracted reporters to his annual birthday interview, regaling them with claims that he had invented a particle-beam weapon capable of bringing down enemy aircraft. Plenty of biographies glamorize Tesla and his eccentricities, but until now none has carefully examined what, how, and why he invented. In this groundbreaking book, W. Bernard Carlson demystifies the legendary inventor, placing him within the cultural and technological context of his time, and focusing on his inventions themselves as well as the creation and maintenance of his celebrity. Drawing on original documents from Tesla's private and public life, Carlson shows how he was an ""idealist"" inventor who sought the perfect experimental realization of a great idea or principle, and who skillfully sold his inventions to the public through mythmaking and illusion. This major biography sheds new light on Tesla's visionary approach to invention and the business strategies behind his most important technological breakthroughs.",5I5c9j8BEn4C,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5I5c9j8BEn4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9781400846559,en,520, ,Princeton University Press,"{'ratings_count': 1584, 'reviews_count': 7733, 'text_reviews_count': 165, 'average_rating': '3.85', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '441', '4-stars': '632', '3-stars': '377', '2-stars': '103', '1-star': '31'}}",science,Tesla,1584,7733,165,3.85

['Sonya Renee Taylor'],Self-Help,"The Body Is Not an Apology The Power of Radical Self-Love Against a global backdrop of war, social upheaval, and personal despair, there is a growing sense of urgency to challenge the systems of oppression that dehumanize bodies and strip us of our shared humanity. Rather than feel helpless in the face of oppression, world-renowned activist, performance poet, and author Sonya Renee Taylor teaches us how to turn to the power of radical self-love in her new book, The Body Is Not an Apology. Radical self-love is the guiding framework that transforms the learned self-hatred of our bodies and the prejudices we have about other people's bodies into a vision of compassion, equity, and justice. In a revolutionary departure from the corporate self-help and body-positivity movement, Taylor forges the inextricable bond between radical self-love and social justice. The first step is recognizing that we have all been indoctrinated into a system of body shame that profits off of our self-hatred. When we ask ourselves, “Who benefits from our collective shame?” we can begin to make the distinction between the messages we are receiving about our bodies or other bodies and the truth. This book moves us beyond our all-too-often hidden lives, where we are easily encouraged to forget that we are whole humans having whole human experiences in our bodies alongside others. Radical self-love encourages us to embark on a personal journey of transformation with thoughtful reflection on the origins of our minds and bodies as a source of strength. In doing this, we not only learn to reject negative messages about ourselves but begin to thwart the very power structures that uphold them. Systems of oppression thrive off of our inability to make peace with bodies and difference. Radical self-love not only dismantles shame and self-loathing in us but has the power to dismantle global systems of injustice—because when we make peace with our bodies, only then do we have the capacity to truly make peace with the bodies of others.",K504DwAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K504DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9781626569775,en,168, ,Berrett-Koehler Publishers,"{'ratings_count': 2924, 'reviews_count': 13032, 'text_reviews_count': 410, 'average_rating': '4.24', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '1390', '4-stars': '1003', '3-stars': '414', '2-stars': '89', '1-star': '28'}}",owned,The Body Is Not an Apology,2924,13032,410,4.24

At a time when we are constantly being asked to retrain and reinvent ourselves to adapt to new technologies and changing industries, this book shows us how we can uncover and develop talents we didn’t realize we had—no matter what our age or background. We’re often told to “follow our passions.” But in Mindshift, Dr. Barbara Oakley shows us how we can broaden our passions. Drawing on the latest neuroscientific insights, Dr. Oakley shepherds us past simplistic ideas of “aptitude” and “ability,” which provide only a snapshot of who we are now—with little consideration about how we can change. Even seemingly “bad” traits, such as a poor memory, come with hidden advantages—like increased creativity. Profiling people from around the world who have overcome learning limitations of all kinds, Dr. Oakley shows us how we can turn perceived weaknesses, such as impostor syndrome and advancing age, into strengths. People may feel like they’re at a disadvantage if they pursue a new field later in life; yet those who change careers can be fertile cross-pollinators: They bring valuable insights from one discipline to another. Dr. Oakley teaches us strategies for learning that are backed by neuroscience so that we can realize the joy and benefits of a learning lifestyle. Mindshift takes us deep inside the world of how people change and grow.

Galileo's discoveries and researches in astronomy -- the phases of Venus, the satellites of Jupiter, and the motion of sunspots -- share the main scenes with his cogent and derisive attacks upon aristotle and his followers. The discussion of the Second Day contains many of Galileo's fundamental contributions to physics -- inertia, the laws of falling bodies, centrifugal force, and the pendulum -- as well as important historical steps in mathematics toward analytic geometry and calculus.

"['Howard Rheingold', 'Anthony Weeks']",Social Science,"Like it or not, knowing how to make use of online tools without being overloaded with too much information is an essential ingredient to personal success in the twenty-first century. But how can we use digital media so that they make us empowered participants rather than passive receivers, grounded, well-rounded people rather than multitasking basket cases? In Net Smart, cyberculture expert Howard Rheingold shows us how to use social media intelligently, humanely, and, above all, mindfully. Mindful use of digital media means thinking about what we are doing, cultivating an ongoing inner inquiry into how we want to spend our time. Rheingold outlines five fundamental digital literacies, online skills that will help us do this: attention, participation, collaboration, critical consumption of information (or ""crap detection""), and network smarts. He explains how attention works, and how we can use our attention to focus on the tiny relevant portion of the incoming tsunami of information. He describes the quality of participation that empowers the best of the bloggers, netizens, tweeters, and other online community participants; he examines how successful online collaborative enterprises contribute new knowledge to the world in new ways; and he teaches us a lesson on networks and network building. Rheingold points out that there is a bigger social issue at work in digital literacy, one that goes beyond personal empowerment. If we combine our individual efforts wisely, it could produce a more thoughtful society: countless small acts like publishing a Web page or sharing a link could add up to a public good that enriches everybody.",o3EvRkgYv2MC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o3EvRkgYv2MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780262300728,en,, ,MIT Press,"{'ratings_count': 283, 'reviews_count': 873, 'text_reviews_count': 47, 'average_rating': '3.99', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '93', '4-stars': '113', '3-stars': '60', '2-stars': '15', '1-star': '2'}}",media,Net Smart,283,873,47,3.99

How To is a guide to the third kind of approach. It's full of highly impractical advice for everything from landing a plane to digging a hole. Bestselling author and cartoonist Randall Munroe explains how to predict the weather by analyzing the pixels of your Facebook photos. He teaches you how to tell if you're a baby boomer or a 90's kid by measuring the radioactivity of your teeth. He offers tips for taking a selfie with a telescope, crossing a river by boiling it, and powering your house by destroying the fabric of space-time. And if you want to get rid of the book once you're done with it, he walks you through your options for proper disposal, including dissolving it in the ocean, converting it to a vapor, using tectonic plates to subduct it into the Earth's mantle, or launching it into the Sun. By exploring the most complicated ways to do simple tasks, Munroe doesn't just make things difficult for himself and his readers. As he did so brilliantly in What If?, Munroe invites us to explore the most absurd reaches of the possible.

It offers a clear framework for understanding contemporary conflicts by showing how geography provides opportunities and limits upon the actions of countries, national groups, and terrorist organizations, and the overarching theme of geopolitical structures and agents requires no previous knowledge of theory or current affairs. Throughout the book, case studies, including the rise of al Qaeda, the Korean conflict, Israel-Palestine, Chechnya and Kashmir, emphasize the multi-faceted nature of conflict. These, along with guided exercises, help explain contemporary global power struggles, the global military actions of the United States, the persistence of nationalist conflicts, the changing role of borders, and the new geopolitics of terrorism. Throughout, the readers are introduced to different theoretical perspectives, including feminist contributions, as both the practice and representation of geopolitics are discussed. Introduction to Geopolitics is extensively illustrated with diagrams, maps, and photographs. Reading this book will provide a deeper and critical understanding of current affairs and facilitate access to higher level course work and essays on geopolitics.

['Edward J. Larson'],Science,"“I often said before starting, that I had no doubt I should frequently repent of the whole undertaking.” So wrote Charles Darwin aboard The Beagle, bound for the Galapagos Islands and what would arguably become the greatest and most controversial discovery in scientific history. But the theory of evolution did not spring full-blown from the head of Darwin. Since the dawn of humanity, priests, philosophers, and scientists have debated the origin and development of life on earth, and with modern science, that debate shifted into high gear. In this lively, deeply erudite work, Pulitzer Prize–winning science historian Edward J. Larson takes us on a guided tour of Darwin’s “dangerous idea,” from its theoretical antecedents in the early nineteenth century to the brilliant breakthroughs of Darwin and Wallace, to Watson and Crick’s stunning discovery of the DNA double helix, and to the triumphant neo-Darwinian synthesis and rising sociobiology today. Along the way, Larson expertly places the scientific upheaval of evolution in cultural perspective: the social and philosophical earthquake that was the French Revolution; the development, in England, of a laissez-faire capitalism in tune with a Darwinian ethos of “survival of the fittest”; the emergence of Social Darwinism and the dark science of eugenics against a backdrop of industrial revolution; the American Christian backlash against evolutionism that culminated in the famous Scopes trial; and on to today’s world, where religious fundamentalists litigate for the right to teach “creation science” alongside evolution in U.S. public schools, even as the theory itself continues to evolve in new and surprising directions. Throughout, Larson trains his spotlight on the lives and careers of the scientists, explorers, and eccentrics whose collaborations and competitions have driven the theory of evolution forward. Here are portraits of Cuvier, Lamarck, Darwin, Wallace, Haeckel, Galton, Huxley, Mendel, Morgan, Fisher, Dobzhansky, Watson and Crick, W. D. Hamilton, E. O. Wilson, and many others. Celebrated as one of mankind’s crowning scientific achievements and reviled as a threat to our deepest values, the theory of evolution has utterly transformed our view of life, religion, origins, and the theory itself, and remains controversial, especially in the United States (where 90% of adults do not subscribe to the full Darwinian vision).

['Morton Hamermesh'],Science,"""A remarkably intelligible survey . . . well organized, well written and very clear throughout."" — Mathematical Reviews This excellent text, long considered one of the best-written, most skillful expositions of group theory and its physical applications, is directed primarily to advanced undergraduate and graduate students in physics, especially quantum physics. No knowledge of group theory is assumed, but the reader is expected to be familiar with quantum mechanics. And while much of the book concerns theory, readers will nevertheless find a large number of physical applications in the fields of crystallography, molecular theory, and atomic and nuclear physics. The first seven chapters of the book are concerned with finite groups, focusing on the central role of the symmetric group. This section concludes with a chapter dealing with the problem of determining group characters, as it discusses Young tableaux, Yamanouchi symbols, and the method of Hund. The remaining five chapters discuss continuous groups, particularly Lie groups, with the final chapter devoted to the ray representation of Lie groups. The author, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Minnesota, has included a generous selection of problems. They are inserted throughout the text at the place where they naturally arise, making the book ideal for self-study as well as for classroom assignment. 77 illustrations.

Did Newton “unweave the rainbow” by reducing it to its prismatic colors, as Keats contended? Did he, in other words, diminish beauty? Far from it, says acclaimed scientist Richard Dawkins; Newton’s unweaving is the key too much of modern astronomy and to the breathtaking poetry of modern cosmology. Mysteries don’t lose their poetry because they are solved: the solution often is more beautiful than the puzzle, uncovering deeper mysteries. With the wit, insight, and spellbinding prose that have made him a bestselling author, Dawkins takes up the most important and compelling topics in modern science, from astronomy and genetics to language and virtual reality, combining them in a landmark statement of the human appetite for wonder. This is the book Richard Dawkins was meant to write: a brilliant assessment of what science is (and isn’t), a tribute to science not because it is useful but because it is uplifting. “A love letter to science, an attempt to counter the perception that science is cold and devoid of aesthetic sensibility . . .

['Donna Hicks'],Medical,"The desire for dignity is universal and powerful. It is a motivating force behind all human interaction--in families, in communities, in the business world, and in relationships at the international level. When dignity is violated, the response is likely to involve aggression, even violence, hatred, and vengeance. On the other hand, when people treat one another with dignity, they become more connected and are able to create more meaningful relationships. Surprisingly, most people have little understanding of dignity, observes Donna Hicks in this important book. She examines the reasons for this gap and offers a new set of strategies for becoming aware of dignity's vital role in our lives and learning to put dignity into practice in everyday life. Drawing on her extensive experience in international conflict resolution and on insights from evolutionary biology, psychology, and neuroscience, the author explains what the elements of dignity are, how to recognize dignity violations, how to respond when we are not treated with dignity, how dignity can restore a broken relationship, why leaders must understand the concept of dignity, and more.

['Susan Freinkel'],Nature,"“This eloquent, elegant book thoughtfully plumbs the . . . consequences of our dependence on plastics” (The Boston Globe, A Best Nonfiction Book of 2011). From pacemakers to disposable bags, plastic built the modern world. But a century into our love affair, we’re starting to realize it’s not such a healthy relationship. As journalist Susan Freinkel points out in this eye-opening book, we’re at a crisis point. Plastics draw on dwindling fossil fuels, leach harmful chemicals, litter landscapes, and destroy marine life. We’re drowning in the stuff, and we need to start making some hard choices. Freinkel tells her story through eight familiar plastic objects: a comb, a chair, a Frisbee, an IV bag, a disposable lighter, a grocery bag, a soda bottle, and a credit card. With a blend of lively anecdotes and analysis, she sifts through scientific studies and economic data, reporting from China and across the United States to assess the real impact of plastic on our lives. Her conclusion is severe, but not without hope. Plastic points the way toward a new creative partnership with the material we love, hate, and can’t seem to live without. “When you write about something so ubiquitous as plastic, you must be prepared to write in several modes, and Freinkel rises to this task. . . . She manages to render the most dull chemical reaction into vigorous, breathless sentences.” —SF Gate “Freinkel’s smart, well-written analysis of this love-hate relationship is likely to make plastic lovers take pause, plastic haters reluctantly realize its value, and all of us understand the importance of individual action, political will, and technological innovation in weaning us off our addiction to synthetics.” —Publishers Weekly “A compulsively interesting story.

Deckard travels this oedipal path in Blade Runner (1982) when he learns that he might be the enemy he has been ordered to pursue. Ecological awareness takes this shape because ecological phenomena have a loop form that is also fundamental to the structure of how things are. The logistics of agricultural society resulted in global warming and hardwired dangerous ideas about life-forms into the human mind. Dark ecology puts us in an uncanny position of radical self-knowledge, illuminating our place in the biosphere and our belonging to a species in a sense that is far less obvious than we like to think. Morton explores the logical foundations of the ecological crisis, which is suffused with the melancholy and negativity of coexistence yet evolving, as we explore its loop form, into something playful, anarchic, and comedic. His work is a skilled fusion of humanities and scientific scholarship, incorporating the theories and findings of philosophy, anthropology, literature, ecology, biology, and physics.

This newly expanded and revised edition covers the latest developments in the field, providing the most up-to-date, concise, and comprehensive book available on these novel materials and their applications. Starting from Maxwell's equations and Fourier analysis, the authors develop the theoretical tools of photonics using principles of linear algebra and symmetry, emphasizing analogies with traditional solid-state physics and quantum theory. They then investigate the unique phenomena that take place within photonic crystals at defect sites and surfaces, from one to three dimensions. This new edition includes entirely new chapters describing important hybrid structures that use band gaps or periodicity only in some directions: periodic waveguides, photonic-crystal slabs, and photonic-crystal fibers.

['Edward O. Wilson'],Science,"National Book Award Finalist. How did humanity originate and why does a species like ours exist on this planet? Do we have a special place, even a destiny in the universe? Where are we going, and perhaps, the most difficult question of all, ""Why?"" In The Meaning of Human Existence, his most philosophical work to date, Pulitzer Prize–winning biologist Edward O. Wilson grapples with these and other existential questions, examining what makes human beings supremely different from all other species. Searching for meaning in what Nietzsche once called ""the rainbow colors"" around the outer edges of knowledge and imagination, Wilson takes his readers on a journey, in the process bridging science and philosophy to create a twenty-first-century treatise on human existence—from our earliest inception to a provocative look at what the future of mankind portends. Continuing his groundbreaking examination of our ""Anthropocene Epoch,"" which he began with The Social Conquest of Earth, described by the New York Times as ""a sweeping account of the human rise to domination of the biosphere,"" here Wilson posits that we, as a species, now know enough about the universe and ourselves that we can begin to approach questions about our place in the cosmos and the meaning of intelligent life in a systematic, indeed, in a testable way. Once criticized for a purely mechanistic view of human life and an overreliance on genetic predetermination, Wilson presents in The Meaning of Human Existence his most expansive and advanced theories on the sovereignty of human life, recognizing that, even though the human and the spider evolved similarly, the poet's sonnet is wholly different from the spider's web. Whether attempting to explicate ""The Riddle of the Human Species,"" ""Free Will,"" or ""Religion""; warning of ""The Collapse of Biodiversity""; or even creating a plausible ""Portrait of E.T.,"" Wilson does indeed believe that humanity holds a special position in the known universe. The human epoch that began in biological evolution and passed into pre-, then recorded, history is now more than ever before in our hands.

Beginning with a powerful critique of historicism and its constraining effects on the geographical imagination, Edward Soja builds on the work of Foucault, Berger, Giddens, Berman, Jameson and, above all, Henri Lefebvre, to argue for a historical and geographical materialism, a radical rethinking of the dialectics of space, time and social being. Soja charts the respatialization of social theory from the still unfolding encounter between Western Marxism and modern geography, through the current debates on the emergence of a postfordist regime of ""flexible accumulation.""

Spüren wir, wenn wir emotional werden, und spüren wir es rechtzeitig? Wie kündigt sich eine emotionale Reaktion in unserem Inneren an? Und sehen andere, was in uns vorgeht? Verrät uns das Gesicht unseres Gegenübers, was er oder sie gerade empfindet? Interpretieren wir Gefühlsausdrücke richtig? Und wie leicht lassen wir uns täuschen? Können wir lernen, unausgesprochene Gefühle bei uns und bei anderen sensibler wahrzunehmen und in angemessener Weise mit dieser Information umzugehen? So viele Fragen – und so wichtig für unser tägliches Miteinander. Der renommierte Psychologe Paul Ekman entfaltet in diesem Buch ein faszinierendes Panorama der Erkenntnisse aus der Emotions- und Gesichterforschung. Er erläutert, wie Gefühle entstehen und wie sie sich in unserer Mimik äußern. Und er zeigt, wie wir dieses Wissen in unseren zwischenmenschlichen Beziehungen praktisch anwenden können. Damit ist sein Buch beides: eine spannende Reise in ein facettenreiches Forschungsfeld und ein Leitfaden für einen bewussteren Umgang mit den eigenen Gefühlen und den Emotionen anderer. Die 2. Auflage enthält ein zusätzliches Kapitel über ""Lügen und Emotionen"". Niemand in der Welt hat Gesichtsausdrücke so intensiv untersucht wie Paul Ekman. In Gefühle lesen präsentiert er – klar, lebhaft und leicht zugänglich – seine faszinierenden Beobachtungen über die offenen und versteckten Ausdrücke von Gefühlen, denen wir Tag für Tag Hunderte von Malen begegnen, die wir aber so oft falsch verstehen oder gar nicht wahrnehmen.

['Daniel Lieberman'],Science,"Story of the Human Body explores how the way we use our bodies is all wrong. From an evolutionary perspective, if normal is defined as what most people have done for millions of years, then it's normal to walk and run 9 -15 kilometers a day to hunt and gather fresh food which is high in fibre, low in sugar, and barely processed. It's also normal to spend much of your time nursing, napping, making stone tools, and gossiping with a small band of people. Our 21st-century lifestyles, argues Dan Lieberman, are out of synch with our stone-age bodies. Never have we been so healthy and long-lived - but never, too, have we been so prone to a slew of problems that were, until recently, rare or unknown, from asthma, to diabetes, to - scariest of all - overpopulation. Story of the Human Body asks how our bodies got to be the way they are, and considers how that evolutionary history - both ancient and recent - can help us evaluate how we use our bodies. How is the present-day state of the human body related to the past? And what is the human body's future?

Putting empathy under the microscope he explores four new ideas: firstly, that we all lie somewhere on an empathy spectrum, from high to low, from six degrees to zero degrees. Secondly that, deep within the brain lies the 'empathy circuit'. How this circuit functions determines where we lie on the empathy spectrum. Thirdly, that empathy is not only something we learn but that there are also genes associated with empathy. And fourthly, while a lack of empathy leads to mostly negative results, is it always negative?

['Adam Higginbotham'],History,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Journalist Adam Higginbotham’s definitive, years-in-the-making account of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster—and a powerful investigation into how propaganda, secrecy, and myth have obscured the true story of one of the twentieth century’s greatest disasters. Early in the morning of April 26, 1986, Reactor Number Four of the Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station exploded, triggering history’s worst nuclear disaster. In the thirty years since then, Chernobyl has become lodged in the collective nightmares of the world: shorthand for the spectral horrors of radiation poisoning, for a dangerous technology slipping its leash, for ecological fragility, and for what can happen when a dishonest and careless state endangers its citizens and the entire world. But the real story of the accident, clouded from the beginning by secrecy, propaganda, and misinformation, has long remained in dispute. Drawing on hundreds of hours of interviews conducted over the course of more than ten years, as well as letters, unpublished memoirs, and documents from recently-declassified archives, Adam Higginbotham has written a harrowing and compelling narrative which brings the disaster to life through the eyes of the men and women who witnessed it firsthand. The result is a masterful nonfiction thriller, and the definitive account of an event that changed history: a story that is more complex, more human, and more terrifying than the Soviet myth. Midnight in Chernobyl is an indelible portrait of one of the great disasters of the twentieth century, of human resilience and ingenuity, and the lessons learned when mankind seeks to bend the natural world to his will—lessons which, in the face of climate change and other threats, remain not just vital but necessary.",3ICADwAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3ICADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,9781501134616,en,538, ,Simon & Schuster,"{'ratings_count': 14624, 'reviews_count': 82370, 'text_reviews_count': 1922, 'average_rating': '4.42', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '7580', '4-stars': '5749', '3-stars': '1143', '2-stars': '114', '1-star': '38'}}",history,Midnight in Chernobyl,14624,82370,1922,4.42

['Norman Doidge'],Science,"An astonishing new scientific discovery called neuroplasticity is overthrowing the centuries-old notion that the adult human brain is fixed and unchanging. It is, instead, able to change its own structure and function, even into old age. Psychiatrist and researcher Norman Doidge, MD, travelled around the United States to meet the brilliant scientists championing neuroplasticity, and the people whose lives they’ve transformed — people whose mental limitations or brain damage were previously seen as unalterable, and whose conditions had long been dismissed as hopeless. We see a woman born with half a brain that rewired itself to work as a whole; a woman labelled retarded who cured her deficits with brain exercises and now cures those of others; blind people who learn to see; learning disorders cured; IQs raised; ageing brains rejuvenated; stroke patients recovering their faculties; children with cerebral palsy learning to move more gracefully; entrenched depression and anxiety disappearing; and lifelong character traits changed. Doidge takes us onto terrain that might seem fantastic. We learn that our thoughts can switch our genes on and off, altering our brain anatomy. We learn how people of average intelligence can, with brain exercises, improve their cognition and perception, develop muscle strength, or learn to play a musical instrument — simply by imagining doing so. Using personal stories from the heart of this neuroplasticity revolution, Dr Doidge has written an immensely moving, inspiring book that will permanently alter the way we look at our brains, human nature, and human potential.",0H7YSoFEs5AC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0H7YSoFEs5AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,1921753099,en,448, ,Scribe Publications,"{'ratings_count': 28554, 'reviews_count': 93570, 'text_reviews_count': 2040, 'average_rating': '4.20', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '13122', '4-stars': '9872', '3-stars': '4191', '2-stars': '885', '1-star': '484'}}",science,The Brain That Changes Itself,28554,93570,2040,4.20

Lo sappiamo, eppure non riusciamo a crederci. E di conseguenza non riusciamo ad agire. Il problema è che l’emergenza ambientale non è una storia facile da raccontare e, soprattutto, non è una buona storia: non spaventa, non affascina, non coinvolge abbastanza da indurci a cambiare la nostra vita. Per questo rimaniamo indifferenti, o paralizzati: la stessa reazione che suscitò Jan Karski, il «testimone inascolta­to», quando cercò di svelare l’orro­re dell’Olocausto e non fu creduto. In tempo di guerra, veniva chiesto ai cittadini di contribuire allo sforzo bellico: ma qual è il confine tra rinuncia e sacrificio, quando in gioco c’è la nostra sopravvivenza, o la ­sopravvivenza dei nostri figli? E quali sono le rinunce necessarie, adesso, per salvare un mondo ormai trasformato in una immensa fattoria a cielo aperto? Nel suo nuovo libro, Jonathan Safran Foer mette in campo tutte le sue risorse di scrittore per raccontare, con straordinario impatto emotivo, la crisi climatica che è anche «crisi della nostra capacità di credere», mescolando in modo originalissimo storie di famiglia, ri­cordi personali, episodi biblici, dati scienti­fici rigorosi e suggestioni futuristiche. Un libro unico, che parte dalla volontà di «convincere degli sconosciuti a fare qualcosa» e termina con un messaggio rivolto ai figli, ai quali ciascun genitore – non solo a parole, ma con le proprie scelte – spera di riuscire a insegnare «la differenza tra correre verso la morte, correre per sfuggire alla morte e correre verso la vita».",2TCqDwAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2TCqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,9788823525511,it,320, ,Guanda,"{'ratings_count': 4754, 'reviews_count': 30826, 'text_reviews_count': 898, 'average_rating': '3.77', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '1254', '4-stars': '1730', '3-stars': '1301', '2-stars': '375', '1-star': '94'}}",science,"Possiamo salvare il mondo, prima di cena",4754,30826,898,3.77

['Brian Greene'],Science,"FROM THE BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF the Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos comes his most expansive and accessible book to date - a book that takes on the grandest question: Is ours the only universe? There was a time when 'universe' meant all there is. Everything. Yet, in recent years discoveries in physics and cosmology have led to a number of scientists to conclude that our universe may be one among many. With crystal-clear prose and inspired use of analogy, Brian Greene show how a range of different 'multiverse' proposals emerges form theories developed to explain the most refined observations of both subatomic particles and the dark depths of space: a multiverse in which you have an infinite number of doppelgangers, each reading this sentence in a distance universe; a multiverse comprising a vast ocean of bubble universes, of which ours is but one; a multiverse that endlessly cycles through time, or one that might be hovering millimetres away yet remains invisible; another in which every possibility allowed by quantum physics is brought to life. Or, perhaps strangest of all, a multiverse made purely of mathematics. Greene, one of our foremost physicists and science writers, takes us on a captivating exploration of these parallel worlds and reveals how much of reality's true nature may be deeply hidden within them. And, with his unrivalled ability to make the most challenging material accessible and entertaining, Greene tackles the core question: How can fundamental science progress if great swaths of reality lie beyond our reach? Sparked by Green's trademark wit and precision, The Hidden Reality is at once a far reaching survey of cutting-edge physics and a remarkable journey to the very edge of reality - a journey grounded firmly in science and limited only by our imagination.",FDZYOo4C2MMC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FDZYOo4C2MMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,9780713999785,en,370, ,Penguin UK,"{'ratings_count': 15972, 'reviews_count': 52977, 'text_reviews_count': 685, 'average_rating': '4.07', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '6200', '4-stars': '5985', '3-stars': '2864', '2-stars': '612', '1-star': '311'}}",science,The Hidden Reality,15972,52977,685,4.07

"['Leonard Mlodinow', 'Stephen Hawking']",Science,"Stephen Hawking's worldwide bestseller, A Brief History of Time, has been a landmark volume in scientific writing. Its author's engaging voice is one reason, and the compelling subjects he addresses is another: the nature of space and time, the role of God in creation, the history and future of the universe. But it is also true that in the years since its publication, readers have repeatedly told Professor Hawking of their great difficulty in understanding some of the book's most important concepts. This is the origin of and the reason for A Briefer History of Time: its author's wish to make its content accessible to readers - as well as to bring it up-to-date with the latest scientific observations and findings. Although this book is literally somewhat 'briefer', it actually expands on the great subjects of the original. Purely technical concepts, such as the mathematics of chaotic boundary conditions, are gone. Conversely, subjects of wide interest that were difficult to follow because they were interspersed throughout the book have now been given entire chapters of their own, including relativity, curved space, and quantum theory. This reorganization has allowed the authors to expand areas of special interest and recent progress, from the latest developments in string theory to exciting developments in the search for a complete, unified theory of all the forces of physics. Like prior editions of the book-but even more so - A Briefer History of Time will guide nonscientists everywhere in the ongoing search for the tantalizing secrets at the heart of time and space.

['Ibnul Qayyim al-Jauziyyah'],Religion,"Memahami makna, hakikat, dan tingkatan-tingkatan cinta menurut ajaran Islam, sebagai jalan penyucian jiwa dan penyelamat dari hawa nafsu, untuk menggapai ridha dan cinta Allah s.w.t. serta meraih kebahagiaan hidup di dunia dan akhirat. Manusia diciptakan memiliki hati sehingga bisa mencintai. Namun, pada saat yang sama, ia juga tak bisa lepas dari hawa nafsu. Hampir mustahil bagi manusia untuk membebaskan diri sepenuhnya dari hawa nafsu. Oleh karena itu, Allah s.w.t. melengkapi hati dengan fitrah (potensi untuk mengenal-Nya) agar manusia tidak dikendalikan hawa nafsu. Dengan fitrah, selain bisa mengenal Allah, manusia dapat menjalankan perintah-Nya, dan menjauhi larangan-Nya. Buku ini berbicara tentang cinta sebagai sesuatu yang fitri dalam diri manusia. Cinta tak mungkin disembunyikan, tapi harus diungkapkan. Cinta kepada harta tak mungkin dikekang, tetapi mesti diungkapkan melalui usaha dan kerja yang halal. Cinta kepada kekuasaan juga tak mungkin dihilangkan, namun mesti diungkapkan melalui sikap adil. Cinta kepada lawan jenis pun tak bisa dikesampingkan, tetapi harus diungkapkan melalui pernikahan yang halal. Buku ini menunjukkan bagaimana cara mengungkapkan cinta dan mengendalikan hawa nafsu dengan fitrah sesuai petunjuk-Nya. Sehingga, cinta itu tidak berubah menjadi cinta terlarang, dan akan membawa manusia kepada puncak cinta tertinggi, yaitu cinta Allah dan Rasul-Nya. -QisthiPress-",BMBzDQAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BMBzDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9789791303552,id,552, ,Qisthi Press,"{'ratings_count': 1220, 'reviews_count': 4452, 'text_reviews_count': 184, 'average_rating': '4.27', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '637', '4-stars': '349', '3-stars': '169', '2-stars': '51', '1-star': '14'}}",religion,Raudhatul Muhibbin,1220,4452,184,4.27

In this definitive guide, Kris offers often-neglected foundational teaching and provides critical advanced training, including how to · discern your calling and grow in your gift · define your divinely appointed sphere of influence and depth of authority · recognize the six different types of prophets--and how to deal with false ones · navigate potential relational difficulties as you step into your gifting · understand the complex ways God communicates · prepare for the common, but dangerous, spiritual attacks prophets face Vallotton offers a balanced view of not only what modern-day prophets are, but also what they are not. You will come away empowered and equipped with the knowledge and skills needed for this beautiful, vital, supernatural ministry. ""The New Testament of Jesus Christ is a message of faith, hope and love. It is called the Good News. My friend and colleague Kris Vallotton is one of the best in the prophetic community to help shape, teach and model these 'Good News Prophets.'

"['Nik Ripken', 'Gregg Lewis']",Religion,"The Insanity of God is the personal and lifelong journey of an ordinary couple from rural Kentucky who thought they were going on just your ordinary missionary pilgrimage, but discovered it would be anything but. After spending over six hard years doing relief work in Somalia, and experiencing life where it looked like God had turned away completely and He was clueless about the tragedies of life, the couple had a crisis of faith and left Africa asking God, ""Does the gospel work anywhere when it is really a hard place? It sure didn't work in Somalia. Nik recalls that, “God had always been so real to me, to Ruth, and to our boys. But was He enough, for the utter weariness of soul I experienced at that time, in that place, under those circumstances?” It is a question that many have asked and one that, if answered, can lead us to a whole new world of faith. How does faith survive, let alone flourish in a place like the Middle East? How can Good truly overcome such evil? How do you maintain hope when all is darkness around you? How can we say “greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world” when it may not be visibly true in that place at that time? How does anyone live an abundant, victorious Christian life in our world’s toughest places? Can Christianity even work outside of Western, dressed-up, ordered nations? If so, how? The Insanity of God tells a story—a remarkable and unique story to be sure, yet at heart a very human story—of the Ripkens’ own spiritual and emotional odyssey. The gripping, narrative account of a personal pilgrimage into some of the toughest places on earth, combined with sobering and insightful stories of the remarkable people of faith Nik and Ruth encountered on their journeys, will serve as a powerful course of revelation, growth, and challenge for anyone who wants to know whether God truly is enough.",cUi5AwAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cUi5AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9781433678646,en,420, ,B&H Publishing Group,"{'ratings_count': 5453, 'reviews_count': 14405, 'text_reviews_count': 694, 'average_rating': '4.57', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '3757', '4-stars': '1206', '3-stars': '386', '2-stars': '74', '1-star': '30'}}",owned,The Insanity of God,5453,14405,694,4.57

The best players know that golf is a game of confidence, and most important, concentration–the ability to focus and block out distraction. The goal of achieving clear thought is also at the heart of Buddhist teachings. In his highly original and groundbreaking book, noted PGA coach and Buddhist instructor, Dr. Joseph Parent, draws on this natural connection and teaches golfers how to clear their minds, achieve ultimate focus, and play in the moment for each shot. Zen Golf presents a simple system for building “mental game mastery.” Dr Parent’s unique PAR Approach (focusing on Preparation, Action, and Response to Results) guides golfers with specific techniques for each aspect of their games. In chapters such as “How to Get From the Practice Tee to the First Tee”, “You Produce What You Fear”, and “How to Enjoy a Bad Round of Golf”, the author shares a personal teaching regimen that has helped improve the games of professionals and amateurs alike. By combining classic insights and stories from Zen tradition, Zen Golf helps eliminate the mental distractions that routinely cause poor shots and loss of concentration, allowing golfers to feel in “the zone” that professionals have learned to master. Clear, concise, and enlightening, Zen Golf shows golfers how to prepare for, execute, and equally important, respond the results of any golf shot.

Richard Bauckham explains how the book's imagery conveyed meaning in its original context and how the book's theology is inseparable from its literary structure and composition. Revelation is seen to offer not an esoteric and encoded forecast of historical events but rather a theocentric vision of the coming of God's universal kingdom, contextualised in the late first-century world dominated by Roman power and ideology. It calls on Christians to confront the political idolatries of the time and to participate in God's purpose of gathering all the nations into his kingdom. Once Revelation is properly grounded in its original context it is seen to transcend that context and speak to the contemporary church.

Otherness, the simple fact of being different in some way, has come to be defined as in and of itself evil. Miroslav Volf contends that if the healing word of the gospel is to be heard today, Christian theology must find ways of speaking that address the hatred of the other. Reaching back to the New Testament metaphor of salvation as reconciliation, Volf proposes the idea of embrace as a theological response to the problem of exclusion. Increasingly we see that exclusion has become the primary sin, skewing our perceptions of reality and causing us to react out of fear and anger to all those who are not within our (ever-narrowing) circle. In light of this, Christians must learn that salvation comes, not only as we are reconciled to God, and not only as we ""learn to live with one another"", but as we take the dangerous and costly step of opening ourselves to the other, of enfolding him or her in the same embrace with which we have been enfolded by God.",qR1rEuksa64C,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qR1rEuksa64C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9781426712333,en,233, ,Abingdon Press,"{'ratings_count': 2069, 'reviews_count': 5385, 'text_reviews_count': 135, 'average_rating': '4.27', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '1060', '4-stars': '653', '3-stars': '253', '2-stars': '68', '1-star': '35'}}",christianity,Exclusion & Embrace,2069,5385,135,4.27

They were composed with the intention of helping the retreatant to discern Jesus in his life, leading then to a personal commitment to follow it. Though the underlying spiritual outlook is Catholic, the exercises are often made nowadays by non-Catholics. The 'Spiritual Exercises' booklet was formally approved in 1548 by Paul III.

Modern culture would have you believe that everyone has a soul mate; that romance is the most important part of a successful marriage; that your spouse is there to help you realize your potential; that marriage does not mean forever, but merely for now; and that starting over after a divorce is the best solution to seemingly intractable marriage issues. But these modern-day assumptions are wrong. Timothy Keller, with insights from Kathy, his wife of thirty-seven years, shows marriage to be a glorious relationship that is also misunderstood and mysterious. The Meaning of Marriage offers instruction on how to have a successful marriage, and is essential reading for anyone who wants to know God and love more deeply in this life.

['Eric L. Johnson'],Religion,"How are Christians to understand and undertake the discipline of psychology? This question has been of keen interest (and sometimes concern) to Christians because of the importance we place on a correct understanding of human nature. Psychology can sometimes seem disconnected from, if not antithetical to, Christian perspectives on life. How are we to understand our Christian beliefs about persons in relation to secular psychological beliefs? This revised edition of a widely appreciated text now presents five models for understanding the relationship between psychology and Christianity. All the essays and responses have been reworked and updated with some new contributors including the addition of a new perspective, the transformative view from John Coe and Todd Hall (Biola University). Also found here is David Powlison (Westminster Theological Seminary) who offers the biblical counseling model. The levels-of-explanation model is advanced by David G. Myers (Hope College), while Stanton L. Jones (Wheaton College) offers an entirely new chapter presenting the integration model. The Christian psychology model is put forth by Robert C. Roberts (Baylor University) now joined by Paul J. Watson (University of Tennesee, Chattanooga). Each of the contributors responds to the other essayists, noting points of agreement as well as problems they see. Eric L. Johnson provides a revised introduction that describes the history of Christians and psychology, as well as a conclusion that considers what might unite the five views and how a reader might evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of each view.

['Amina Wadud'],Social Science,"Fourteen centuries of Islamic thought have produced a legacy of interpretive readings of the Qu'ran written almost entirely by men. Now, with Qu'ran and Woman, Amina Wadud provides a first interpretive reading by a woman, a reading which validates the female voice in the Qu'ran and brings it out of the shadows. Muslim progressives have long argued that it is not the religion but patriarchal interpretation and implementation of the Qu'ran that have kept women oppressed. For many, the way to reform is the reexamination and reinterpretation of religious texts. Qu'ran and Woman contributes a gender inclusive reading to one of the most fundamental disciplines in Islamic thought, Qu'ranic exegesis. Wadud breaks down specific texts and key words which have been used to limit women's public and private role, even to justify violence toward Muslim women, revealing that their original meaning and context defy such interpretations. What her analysis clarifies is the lack of gender bias, precedence, or prejudice in the essential language of the Qur'an. Despite much Qu'ranic evidence about the significance of women, gender reform in Muslim society has been stubbornly resisted. Wadud's reading of the Qu'ran confirms women's equality and constitutes legitimate grounds for contesting the unequal treatment that women have experienced historically and continue to experience legally in Muslim communities. The Qu'ran does not prescribe one timeless and unchanging social structure for men and women, Wadud argues lucidly, affirming that the Qu'ran holds greater possibilities for guiding human society to a more fulfilling and productive mutual collaboration between men and women than as yet attained by Muslims or non-Muslims.",PjeHD2soxaEC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PjeHD2soxaEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0198029438,en,145, ,Oxford University Press,"{'ratings_count': 1767, 'reviews_count': 4921, 'text_reviews_count': 64, 'average_rating': '4.24', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '977', '4-stars': '404', '3-stars': '268', '2-stars': '73', '1-star': '45'}}",religion,Qur'an and Woman,1767,4921,64,4.24

These were the final shouts nine year-old Kim Phuc heard before her world dissolved into flames—before napalm bombs fell from the sky, burning away her clothing and searing deep into her skin. It’s a moment forever captured, an iconic image that has come to define the horror and violence of the Vietnam War. Kim was left for dead in a morgue; no one expected her to survive the attack. Napalm meant fire, and fire meant death. Against all odds, Kim lived—but her journey toward healing was only beginning. When the napalm bombs dropped, everything Kim knew and relied on exploded along with them: her home, her country’s freedom, her childhood innocence and happiness. The coming years would be marked by excruciating treatments for her burns and unrelenting physical pain throughout her body, which were constant reminders of that terrible day. Kim survived the pain of her body ablaze, but how could she possibly survive the pain of her devastated soul? Fire Road is the true story of how she found the answer in a God who suffered Himself; a Savior who truly understood and cared about the depths of her pain.

"['Barbara Drake Boehm ', 'Melanie Holcomb']",Art,"Medieval Jerusalem was a vibrant international center, home to multiple cultures, faiths, and languages. Harmonious and dissonant voices from many lands, including Persians, Turks, Greeks, Syrians, Armenians, Georgians, Copts, Ethiopians, Indians, and Europeans, passed in the narrow streets of a city not much larger than midtown Manhattan. Patrons, artists, pilgrims, poets, and scholars from Christian, Jewish, and Islamic traditions focused their attention on the Holy City, endowing and enriching its sacred buildings, creating luxury goods for its residents, and praising its merits. This artistic fertility was particularly in evidence between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries, notwithstanding often devastating circumstances—from the earthquake of 1033 to the fierce battles of the Crusades. So strong a magnet was Jerusalem that it drew out the creative imagination of even those separated from it by great distance, from as far north as Scandinavia to as far east as present-day China. This publication is the first to define these four centuries as a singularly creative moment in a singularly complex city. Through absorbing essays and incisive discussions of nearly 200 works of art, Jerusalem, 1000–1400: Every People Under Heaven explores not only the meaning of the city to its many faiths and its importance as a destination for tourists and pilgrims but also the aesthetic strands that enhanced and enlivened the medieval city that served as the crossroads of the known world.",Ay30DAAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ay30DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9781588395986,en,352, ,Metropolitan Museum of Art,"{'ratings_count': 13, 'reviews_count': 70, 'text_reviews_count': 6, 'average_rating': '4.77', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '10', '4-stars': '3', '3-stars': '0', '2-stars': '0', '1-star': '0'}}",history,"Jerusalem, 1000–1400",13,70,6,4.77

['Hannah Arendt'],Religion,"Although Hannah Arendt is not primarily known as a Jewish thinker, she probably wrote more about Jewish issues than any other topic. When she was in her mid-twenties and still living in Germany, Arendt wrote about the history of German Jews as a people living in a land that was not their own. In 1933, at the age of twenty-six, she fled to France, where she helped to arrange for German and eastern European Jewish youth to quit Europe and become pioneers in Palestine. During her years in Paris, Arendt’s principal concern was with the transformation of antisemitism from a social prejudice to a political policy, which would culminate in the Nazi “final solution” to the Jewish question–the physical destruction of European Jewry. After France fell at the beginning of World War II, Arendt escaped from an internment camp in Gurs and made her way to the United States. Almost immediately upon her arrival in New York she wrote one article after another calling for a Jewish army to fight the Nazis, and for a new approach to Jewish political thinking. After the war, her attention was focused on the creation of a Jewish homeland in a binational (Arab-Jewish) state of Israel. Although Arendt’s thoughts eventually turned more to the meaning of human freedom and its inseparability from political life, her original conception of political freedom cannot be fully grasped apart from her experience as a Jew. In 1961 she attended Adolf Eichmann’s trial in Jerusalem. Her report on that trial, Eichmann in Jerusalem, provoked an immense controversy, which culminated in her virtual excommunication from the worldwide Jewish community. Today that controversy is the subject of serious re-evaluation, especially among younger people in America, Europe, and Israel. The publication of The Jewish Writings–much of which has never appeared before–traces Arendt’s life and thought as a Jew. It will put an end to any doubts about the centrality, from beginning to end, of Arendt’s Jewish experience.",RIE2KKIXhLQC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RIE2KKIXhLQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0307496287,en,559, ,Schocken,"{'ratings_count': 53, 'reviews_count': 258, 'text_reviews_count': 4, 'average_rating': '4.09', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '24', '4-stars': '16', '3-stars': '10', '2-stars': '0', '1-star': '3'}}",philosophy,The Jewish Writings,53,258,4,4.09

['Rebecca Konyndyk DeYoung'],Religion,"Contemporary culture trivializes the ""seven deadly sins,"" or vices, as if they have no serious moral or spiritual implications. Glittering Vices clears this misconception by exploring the traditional meanings of gluttony, sloth, lust, and others. It offers a brief history of how the vices were compiled and an eye-opening explication of how each sin manifests itself in various destructive behaviors. Readers gain practical understanding of how the vices shape our culture today and how to correctly identify and eliminate the deeply rooted patterns of sin that are work in their own lives. This accessible book is essential for any reader interested in spiritual disciplines and character formation. EXCERPT Very simply, a virtue (or vice) is acquired through practice--repeated activity that increases our proficiency at the activity and gradually forms our character. . . . We often need external incentives and sanctions to get us through the initial stages of the process, when our old, entrenched desires still pull us toward the opposite behavior. But with encouragement, discipline, and often a role model or mentor, practice can make things feel more natural and enjoyable as we gradually develop the internal values and desires corresponding to our outward behavior. Virtue often develops, that is, from the outside-in.

['Talal Asad'],Religion,"Opening with the provocative query what might an anthropology of the secular look like? this book explores the concepts, practices, and political formations of secularism, with emphasis on the major historical shifts that have shaped secular sensibilities and attitudes in the modern West and the Middle East. Talal Asad proceeds to dismantle commonly held assumptions about the secular and the terrain it allegedly covers. He argues that while anthropologists have oriented themselves to the study of the strangeness of the non-European world and to what are seen as non-rational dimensions of social life (things like myth, taboo, and religion),the modern and the secular have not been adequately examined. The conclusion is that the secular cannot be viewed as a successor to religion, or be seen as on the side of the rational. It is a category with a multi-layered history, related to major premises of modernity, democracy, and the concept of human rights.

['Mother Teresa'],Religion,"Mother Teresa’s relationship with God and her commitment to those she served—the poorest of the poor—is here powerfully explored in her own words. Taken largely from her private lessons to her sisters, published here for the first time, Where There is Love, There is God unveils her extraordinary faith in and surrender to God’s will. This book is in some way a sequel to Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light, in which her own very private spiritual struggles were explained. Sent to alleviate the sufferings of the poor, she assumed their struggles and pain in the depths of her heart. This led to particularly intense anguish which she lived through with heroic courage and fidelity over several decades. As important as this aspect of her life is, that remarkable testimony of her life and her words intensifies the need and desire to know more of her thought. There is much she can teach us as we face our daily struggles or sufferings, which can at times be unusually severe. Where There is Love, There is God, though not an exhaustive anthology of Mother Teresa’s teaching, nonetheless shows what she believed and taught about important issues that confront all people. Due to her constant interaction with people of diverse backgrounds, no life situation was foreign to her and in this book her role is primarily one of teacher and guide. Love is perhaps the word that best summarizes Mother Teresa’s life and message. The title reflects what she proclaimed during her entire life: God is alive, present, and “still loves the world through you and through me”. Mother Teresa sought to be an extension of God’s heart and hands in the world of today. She was called to be a missionary of charity, a carrier of God’s love to each person she met, especially those most in need. Yet she did not think that this was a vocation uniquely hers; each person is in some way called to be a carrier of God’s love. Through the practical and timely advice she offers, Mother Teresa sets us on the path to closer union with God and greater love for our brothers and sisters. MOTHER TERESA (1910–1997) was born in Skopje (present-day Macedonia), and joined the Sisters of Loreto in Dublin in 1928. She left the Loreto order in 1948 to begin the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta. Her service to the poorest of the poor became her life’s work. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and was beatified in 2003. Editor of Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light, FATHER BRIAN KOLODIEJCHUK, M.C., Ph.D., was associated with Mother Teresa for twenty years and is now director of the Mother Teresa Center, which has offices in California, Mexico, India, and Italy. “What you are doing I cannot do, what I’m doing you cannot do, but together we are doing something beautiful for God, and this is the greatness of God’s love for us—To give us the opportunity to become holy through the works of love that we do because holiness is not the luxury of the few. It is a very simple duty for you, for me, you in your position, in your work and I and others, each one of us in the work, in the life that we have given our word of honor to God.…You must put your love for God in a living action.” -Mother Teresa, From Where There is Love, There is God",maWcsEcxCTYC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=maWcsEcxCTYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780385531795,en,240, ,Image,"{'ratings_count': 358, 'reviews_count': 1531, 'text_reviews_count': 47, 'average_rating': '4.21', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '187', '4-stars': '93', '3-stars': '54', '2-stars': '15', '1-star': '9'}}",saints,"Where There Is Love, There Is God",358,1531,47,4.21

In this new book David Naugle provides the best discussion yet of the history and contemporary use of worldview as a totalizing approach to faith and life. This informative volume first locates the origin of worldview in the writings of Immanuel Kant and surveys the rapid proliferation of its use throughout the English-speaking world. Naugle then provides the first study ever undertaken of the insights of major Western philosophers on the subject of worldview and offers an original examination of the role this concept has played in the natural and social sciences. Finally, Naugle gives the concept biblical and theological grounding, exploring the unique ways that worldview has been used in the Evangelical, Orthodox, and Catholic traditions.

Grounded in an exploration of logic (which Ibn Sina described as the gate to knowledge) and happiness (the ultimate human goal), the text illuminates the divine, the human being, and the nature of things through a wide-ranging discussion of topics. The sections of Physics and Metaphysics deal with the nature of bodies and souls as well as existence, creation, and knowledge. Especially important are Ibn Sina's views of God's knowledge of particulars, which generated much controversy in medieval Islamic and Christian philosophical and theological circles and provoked a strong rejection by eleventh-century philosopher al-Ghazali. This book provides the first annotated English translation of Physics and Metaphysics and edits the original Arabic text on which the translation is based. It begins with a detailed analysis of the text, followed by a translation of the three classes or groups of ideas in the Physics (On the Substance of Bodies, On the Directions and Their Primary and Secondary Bodies, and On the Terrestrial and Celestial Souls) and the four in the Metaphysics (On Existence and Its Causes, Creation Ex Nihilo and Immediate Creation, On Ends, on Their Principles, and on the Arrangement [of Existence], and On Abstraction. The Metaphysics closes with a significant discussion of the concepts of providence, good, and evil, which Ibn Sina uses to introduce a theodicy. Researchers, faculty, and students in philosophy, theology, religion, and intellectual history will find in this work a useful and necessary source for understanding Ibn Sina's philosophical thought and, more generally, the medieval Islamic and Christian study of nature, the world beyond, psychology, God, and the concept of evil.",6KTcAgAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6KTcAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780231537421,en,249, ,Columbia University Press,"{'ratings_count': 2, 'reviews_count': 28, 'text_reviews_count': 0, 'average_rating': '4.00', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '0', '4-stars': '2', '3-stars': '0', '2-stars': '0', '1-star': '0'}}",study-religion-islam,Ibn Sina’s Remarks and Admonitions: Physics and Metaphysics,2,28,0,4.00

['Thich Nhat Hanh'],Religion,"Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh, bestselling author of Peace is Every Step and one of the most respected and celebrated religious leaders in the world, delivers a powerful path to happiness through mastering life's most important skill. How do we say what we mean in a way that the other person can really hear? How can we listen with compassion and understanding? Communication fuels the ties that bind, whether in relationships, business, or everyday interactions. Most of us, however, have never been taught the fundamental skills of communication—or how to best represent our true selves. Effective communication is as important to our well-being and happiness as the food we put into our bodies. It can be either healthy (and nourishing) or toxic (and destructive). In this precise and practical guide, Zen master and Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh reveals how to listen mindfully and express your fullest and most authentic self. With examples from his work with couples, families, and international conflicts, The Art of Communicating helps us move beyond the perils and frustrations of misrepresentation and misunderstanding to learn the listening and speaking skills that will forever change how we experience and impact the world.",yxnXkl5Sj4AC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yxnXkl5Sj4AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780062224682,en,176, ,Harper Collins,"{'ratings_count': 4276, 'reviews_count': 12709, 'text_reviews_count': 409, 'average_rating': '4.16', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '1835', '4-stars': '1555', '3-stars': '664', '2-stars': '161', '1-star': '61'}}",philosophy,The Art of Communicating,4276,12709,409,4.16

The chapters in this small book can be read in any order, and are simple and easy to understand. Each story, inspirational quote, and teaching offers mindfulness-enhancing techniques that anyone can relate to. You don't need to be a Buddhist to find the Buddha's teachings motivational. As the Dalai Lama says, ""Don't try to use what you learn from Buddhism to be a Buddhist; use it to be a better whatever-you-already-are."" So whether it's Mother Teresa's acts of charity, Gandhi's perseverance, or your aunt Betty's calm demeanor, as long as you're motivated to be better today than you were yesterday, it doesn't matter who inspires you. Regardless of religion, geographical region, race, ethnicity, color, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, flexibility, or vulnerability, if you do good you feel good, and if you do bad you feel bad.

['Peter Enns'],Religion,"The controversial Bible scholar and author of The Evolution of Adam recounts his transformative spiritual journey in which he discovered a new, more honest way to love and appreciate God’s Word. Trained as an evangelical Bible scholar, Peter Enns loved the Scriptures and shared his devotion, teaching at Westminster Theological Seminary. But the further he studied the Bible, the more he found himself confronted by questions that could neither be answered within the rigid framework of his religious instruction or accepted among the conservative evangelical community. Rejecting the increasingly complicated intellectual games used by conservative Christians to “protect” the Bible, Enns was conflicted. Is this what God really requires? How could God’s plan for divine inspiration mean ignoring what is really written in the Bible? These questions eventually cost Enns his job—but they also opened a new spiritual path for him to follow. The Bible Tells Me So chronicles Enns’s spiritual odyssey, how he came to see beyond restrictive doctrine and learned to embrace God’s Word as it is actually written. As he explores questions progressive evangelical readers of Scripture commonly face yet fear voicing, Enns reveals that they are the very questions that God wants us to consider—the essence of our spiritual study.",WOxzAwAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WOxzAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780062272058,en,288, ,Harper Collins,"{'ratings_count': 3499, 'reviews_count': 9317, 'text_reviews_count': 518, 'average_rating': '4.21', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '1594', '4-stars': '1291', '3-stars': '437', '2-stars': '123', '1-star': '54'}}",religion,The Bible Tells Me So,3499,9317,518,4.21

The first series in the trilogy is The Glory of the Lord, and following this Theo-Drama series will be Theo-Logic. In this series ""the good"" has been the focus. Balthasar maintains that it is in the theater that man attempts a kind of transcendence to observe and to judge his own truth about himself. He sees the phenomenon of theater as a source of fruitfulness for theological reflection on the cosmic drama that involves earth and heaven. This fifth volume is trinitarian, focusing on the mystery of God. He draws heavily on Scripture and many passages from the works of the mystic Adrienne von Spyer.

So asserts Daniel Jütte in this engrossing, vivid, and award-winning work. He maintains that the widespread acceptance and even reverence for this “economy of secrets” in premodern Europe created a highly complex and sometimes perilous space for mutual contact between Jews and Christians. Surveying the interactions between the two religious groups in a wide array of secret sciences and practices, the author relates true stories of colorful “professors of secrets” and clandestine encounters. In the process Jütte examines how our current notion of secrecy is radically different in this era of WikiLeaks, Snowden, etc., as opposed to centuries earlier when the truest, most important knowledge was generally considered to be secret by definition.",YfXzCAAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YfXzCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780300190984,en,448, ,Yale University Press,"{'ratings_count': 6, 'reviews_count': 48, 'text_reviews_count': 1, 'average_rating': '4.00', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '1', '4-stars': '4', '3-stars': '1', '2-stars': '0', '1-star': '0'}}",history,The Age of Secrecy,6,48,1,4.00

Thus the Celts provide an immediate bridge that leads to a very ancient world. Focusing on the Brythonic Celtic material and the ""Taliesin"" cult whose lineage preserved the mysteries through the Mabinogion and other texts, Awen: the Quest of the Celtic Mysteries reveals the sources of the British sacred tradition right back to the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, and, as some believe, further back still to even more ancient sources. Awen is a Welsh word often translated as ""inspiration."" However, in its fullness it has a much deeper meaning, an irradiation of the soul from paradisal origins. In the context of the Celtic folk-soul it casts the paradisal pattern by which the people and the land were harmonised. Through the aligned symbolism of the goddess, the sacred king and the stars, a compelling picture is built of a thriving mystery tradition which marries the constellations to the landscape, exploring as an example the interwoven five-fold and seven-fold stellar geometry of Moel ty Uchaf stone circle in North Wales, and the stellar alignments on the landscape of Cadair Idris.",7dU2kfUVUaQC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7dU2kfUVUaQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9781908011367,en,266, ,Skylight Press,"{'ratings_count': 7, 'reviews_count': 80, 'text_reviews_count': 1, 'average_rating': '3.86', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '1', '4-stars': '4', '3-stars': '2', '2-stars': '0', '1-star': '0'}}",pagan,Awen,7,80,1,3.86

Its location and design are the subjects of countless rumors, myths, and legends. Mysteries of Templar Treasure and the Holy Grail, formerly published as The Secrets of Rennes le Chateau, delves into the reality behind the action and adventure of The Da Vinci Code. Rennes le Chateau has plenty of secrets: buried treasure, unsolved murders, supernatural powers, codes on parchments and tombstones, not to mention clues concealed in statues and paintings, enigmatic priests who controlled immense wealth, and secret societies that are still active today. The authors survey the arcane history and secrets of Rennes le Chateau, including its relationship to the Merovingian bloodline of Christ. The Chateau is a possible location of an immense treasure, such as a Templar, Cathar, or Priory of Sion hoard. The final resting place of a famous artifact like the Ark of the Covenant, the Spear of Longinus, the Emerald Tablets of Hermes Trismegistus- or even the Holy Grail. The authors also examine Rennes le Chateau's proximity to Cathar and Templar fortresses, its mystical layout, and its location on the same Paris meridian as so many other esoteric mysteries. Extensive appendices in the book offer possible solutions to secret cryptograms, point out odd connections and commonalities between Rennes le Chateau and J.R.R.

In this book Eugene Thacker suggests that we look to the genre of horror as offering a way of thinking about the unthinkable world. To confront this idea is to confront the limit of our ability to understand the world in which we live - a central motif of the horror genre. In the Dust of This Planet explores these relationships between philosophy and horror. In Thacker's hands, philosophy is not academic logic-chopping; instead, it is the thought of the limit of all thought, especially as it dovetails into occultism, demonology, and mysticism. Likewise, Thacker takes horror to mean something beyond the focus on gore and scare tactics, but as the under-appreciated genre of supernatural horror in fiction, film, comics, and music.",yV6tmAEACAAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yV6tmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,184694676X,en,170, ,Zero Books,"{'ratings_count': 1752, 'reviews_count': 8573, 'text_reviews_count': 185, 'average_rating': '3.69', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '411', '4-stars': '652', '3-stars': '470', '2-stars': '178', '1-star': '41'}}",philosophy,In the Dust of This Planet,1752,8573,185,3.69

From before the beginning (which was also, according to them, already the end), the adepts of the Architectonic Order of the Eschaton have worked tirelessly to secure the past, present, and future against the incursions of Neolemurian time-sorcery, eliminating all polytemporal activity, stitching up the future, sealing every breach and covering every track. According to the AOE, the CCRU ""does not, has not, and will never exist."" And yet... The texts collected here document the CCRU's perilous efforts to catalogue the traces of Lemurian occulture, bringing together the scattered accounts of those who had stumbled upon lagooned relics of nonhuman intelligence--a project that led ultimately to the recovery of the Numogram and the reconstruction of the principles of Lemurian time-sorcery--before disintegrating into collective schizophrenia and two decades of absolute obscurity. Meshing together fiction, number theory, voodoo, philosophy, anthropology, palate tectonics, information science, semiotics, geotraumatics, occultism, and other nameless knowledges, in these pages the incomplete evidence gathered by explorers including Burroughs, Blavatsky, Lovecraft, Jung, Barker, J.G. Ballard, William Gibson, and Octavia Butler, but also the testimony of more obscure luminaries such as Echidna Stillwell, Oskar Sarkon, and Madame Centauri, are clarified and subjected to systematic investigation, comparison, and assessment so as to gauge the real stakes of the Time-War still raging behind the collapsing façade of reality. One of the most compelling and unnerving collective research enterprises to have surfaced in the twentieth century, the real pertinence of the CCRU's work is only now beginning to reveal itself to an unbelieving world. To plunge into the tangled mesh of these conspiracies, weird tales, numerical plagues, and suggestive coincidences is to test your sense of reality beyond the limits of reasonable tolerance--to enter the sphere of unbelief, where demonic currents prowl, where fictions make themselves real.

['Mallory Ortberg'],Fiction,"A collection of darkly playful stories based on classic folk and fairy tales (but with a feminist spin) that find the sinister in the familiar and the familiar in the alien—from Mallory Ortberg, author of Texts From Jane Eyre. From Mallory Ortberg comes a collection of darkly mischievous stories based on classic fairy tales. Adapted from her beloved ""Children's Stories Made Horrific"" series, ""The Merry Spinster"" takes up the trademark wit that endeared Ortberg to readers of both The Toast and her best-selling debut Texts From Jane Eyre. The feature has become among the most popular on the site, with each entry bringing in tens of thousands of views, as the stories proved a perfect vehicle for Ortberg’s eye for deconstruction and destabilization. Sinister and inviting, familiar and alien all at the same time, The Merry Spinster updates traditional children's stories and fairy tales with elements of psychological horror, emotional clarity, and a keen sense of feminist mischief. Readers of The Toast will instantly recognize Ortberg's boisterous good humor and uber-nerd swagger: those new to Ortberg's oeuvre will delight in her unique spin on fiction, where something a bit mischievous and unsettling is always at work just beneath the surface. Unfalteringly faithful to its beloved source material, The Merry Spinster also illuminates the unsuspected, and frequently, alarming emotional complexities at play in the stories we tell ourselves, and each other, as we tuck ourselves in for the night.

Following a very public humiliation, Thomas is looking for a story to get him back on the map-and free of the small town newspaper where he serves out his exile. The apparent murder of a stranger seems to be just what the opportunistic reporter needs, until he discovers the death is merely the start of something bigger. Also investigating the murder is Sheriff Jezebel Woods, who doesn't approve of Thomas' sensationalist intentions. Mounting deaths force the pair to set aside their differences to confront a force that threatens to destroy the entire town. At the center of the mystery is the disappearance of a boy named Salem Alistair, who designed a series of grotesque scarecrows for his parents' farm-scarecrows that are turning up at each subsequent crime scene. Thomas begins to doubt his uneasy alliance with the sheriff when he realizes Jezebel has her own secret history with Salem Alistair. Thomas and Jezebel are completely unprepared to face the supernatural force at odds with Gray Hollow. As the killings continue, and the town slowly begins to yield its dark secrets, the truth will pit Thomas and Jezebel on a collision course with true evil.",PQx_jwEACAAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PQx_jwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,1620066467,en,286, ,"Sunbury Press, Incorporated","{'ratings_count': 107, 'reviews_count': 1546, 'text_reviews_count': 24, 'average_rating': '4.15', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '47', '4-stars': '36', '3-stars': '18', '2-stars': '5', '1-star': '1'}}",horror,The Keeper of the Crows,107,1546,24,4.15

Each of them will need spirit, courage and immense luck to survive the next forty-eight hours. Corrie Rankin is already a legend at MI6 when he is called back with little regard for the horrors of his recent past. Corrie is sent to take advantage of a chance to take down a high value player in the war against Al Qaeda - and, a chance for the Brits to succeed without begging help from the Americans. The sniper and his spotter who will go with Corrie are less than top team, but the best that can be found if the mission is to stay 'deniable'. And once the three misfits are in-country, they must rely on intelligence brought to them by a young British Jihadi - on the ground and close to the target - and now turned. And, close to him, is an archaeologist digging in the ruins of the Queen of Sheba' civilisation who will be their cut-out contact point. The mission is the brain-child of an apparently old, fat fool in a striped cricket blazer, a sweating figure of fun among the ex-pat community across the border in Muscat. This is Jericho ... not as old or fat or foolish as he appears, nor as harmless. This is Jericho's War. The weapons it deploys, the brutal aims it pursues, are state of the art.

Truman -- a man with a mysterious past -- is persuaded to go back to Sudan and bribe a hostile tribe to allow mining of the incredibly valuable minerals now discovered on their land. But he and his backers are not the only people to be after the rare earth - Truman also encounters various elements of the SIS, renegade Russians and Serbians, all of whom are prepared to use far more violent methods to seize what they want. Rescued by the tribe themselves from a brutal attack, Truman - unsure who his greatest enemies are -- becomes fascinated by the tribe's way of life, by the woman who is their prophetess and by his gradually returning memories",ajL6NwAACAAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ajL6NwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0007130236,en,384, , ,"{'ratings_count': 87, 'reviews_count': 176, 'text_reviews_count': 13, 'average_rating': '3.36', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '14', '4-stars': '23', '3-stars': '35', '2-stars': '10', '1-star': '5'}}",thriller,Rare Earth,87,176,13,3.36

['Robin Yocum'],True Crime,"During the four-plus years that Robin Yocum was the police reporter for the Columbus Dispatch, he covered more than 1,000 deaths. Some were flukes; some were deserved. He interviewed decorated cops and transvestites, pimps, prostitutes, and pushers, killers, and child molesters. He went on drug, porn, and moonshine raids. He waded through cornfields looking for missing planes and children, a county landfill in a vain search for child pornography, through a squalid home with knee-high trash and a flooded basement where a family of ducks had taken up residence. He ruined so many slacks and shoes that he began wearing Sansabelt and cowboy boots because he needed something he could hose off at the end of his shift. Dead Before Deadline...and Other Tales from the Police Beat chronicles Yocum's years on the police beat for the Dispatch. The tales are sometimes sad, and sometimes funny, and sometimes in odd combination of both. Yocum takes the reader into the life behind the pyline and into the gritty world of crime reporting. It is not a rehash of old headlines, but Yocum explores his interactions with people who made headlines for all the wrong reasons. He tells of a prison interview with a 17-year-old who had murdered both parents; recounts the words of a mother who lost her son to senseless violence; and details a grieving father's plan to kill his former son-in-law. The police beat is not without its humor, and Yocum captures the personalities of the oddball set of characters.

Through the compelling stories of Black women who have been most affected by racism, persistent poverty, class inequality, limited access to support resources or institutions, Beth E. Richie shows that the threat of violence to Black women has never been more serious, demonstrating how conservative legal, social, political and economic policies have impacted activism in the U.S.-based movement to end violence against women. Richie argues that Black women face particular peril because of the ways that race and culture have not figured centrally enough in the analysis of the causes and consequences of gender violence. As a result, the extent of physical, sexual and other forms of violence in the lives of Black women, the various forms it takes, and the contexts within which it occurs are minimized—at best—and frequently ignored. Arrested Justice brings issues of sexuality, class, age, and criminalization into focus right alongside of questions of public policy and gender violence, resulting in a compelling critique, a passionate re-framing of stories, and a call to action for change.",oKsUCgAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oKsUCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780814776223,en,229, ,NYU Press,"{'ratings_count': 184, 'reviews_count': 1655, 'text_reviews_count': 20, 'average_rating': '4.35', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '97', '4-stars': '63', '3-stars': '16', '2-stars': '8', '1-star': '0'}}",education,Arrested Justice,184,1655,20,4.35

"['W. Seth Carus', 'Center for Counterproliferation Research']",Political Science,"During the past five years, the threat of bioterrorism has become a subject of widespread concern. Journalists, academics, and policy analysts have considered the subject, and in most cases found much to alarm them. Most significantly, it has captured the attention of policy makers at all levels of government in the United States. Unfortunately, bioterrorism remains a poorly understood subject. Many policymakers and policy analysts present apocalyptic visions of the threat, contending that it is only a matter of time before some terrorist uses biological agents to cause mass casualties. In contrast, other analysts argue that the empirical record provides no basis for concern, and thus largely dismiss the potential threat. Neither approach is helpful. Imagining catastrophic threats inevitably leads to a requirement for impossibly large response capabilities. In contrast, denying the potential danger altogether leads to the kind of tunnel vision that led U.S. intelligence officials to totally ignore the emergence of Aum Shinrikyo in Japan, despite its overtly hostile attitude towards the United States. This study takes an intermediate course. It provides empirical evidence to support the views of those who argue that biological agents are difficult to use. It also provides abundant evidence that some people have desired to inflict mass casualties on innocent populations through employment of biological agents. Fortunately, these accounts also suggest that such people lacked the capability to follow through with their plans. The research also casts considerable doubt on our ability to predict which biological agents a perpetrator might employ. While some analysts assume that terrorists will use those agents that proved of most interest to state weapons programs, bioterrorists and biocriminals have acquired and used agents of little or no value as weapons of war.",1jEP8Ve4zwgC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1jEP8Ve4zwgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,1410100235,en,, ,"The Minerva Group, Inc.","{'ratings_count': 5, 'reviews_count': 13, 'text_reviews_count': 0, 'average_rating': '3.60', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '0', '4-stars': '3', '3-stars': '2', '2-stars': '0', '1-star': '0'}}",science,Bioterrorism and Biocrimes,5,13,0,3.60

Are we forced to choose between classical and poststructuralist approaches in explaining surveillance? Why is surveillance both expanding globally and focusing more on the human body? Surveillance Society takes a post-privacy approach to surveillance with a fresh look at the relations between technology and society. Personal data is collected from us all the time, whether we know it or not, through identity numbers, camera images, or increasingly by other means such as fingerprint and retinal scans. This book examines the constant computer-based scrutiny of ordinary daily life for citizens and consumers as they participate in contemporary societies. It argues that to understand what is happening we have to go beyond Orwellian alarms and cries for more privacy to see how such surveillance also reinforces divisions by sorting people into social categories. The issues spill over narrow policy and legal boundaries to generate responses at several levels including local consumer groups, internet activism, and international social movements.

Wild was both part of the policy system in eighteenth-century England, and also one of the most adroit criminals of the age. In the 1720s, London suffered the worst crime waves in its history. Civic corruption took place on a staggering scale. The government's answer was to pay a bounty for the capture of robbers, thus creating a class of professional informers. Wild was applauded as the most efficient thief hunter and gang breaker in British society; but his own posse of thief catchers was basically a front behind which he was able to control the underground world, through a complex system of blackmail, perjury, and terror which the book details. All who opposed him were betrayed to the law, and in the struggle for power Wild sacrificed several hundred of his own people to the hangman. No one since his time, with the exception of Lavrenti Beria of the late Stalin era GPU so nearly succeeded in bringing the underworld under the control of one system of power. At one level, this is a biography of the world's first supercriminal. At another, it is a sociology of criminal behavior and its political consequences. Howson sheds fresh light, not only on a figure who has become famous in literature, but more important, on the entire structure of gang life. The book is written as a terrifying and fascinating study of a historical epoch; it also offers a completely fresh picture of the birth of modern organized-crime families as part of modern organized political systems.",zJoHnwEACAAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zJoHnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0887380328,en,338, ,Transaction Publishers,"{'ratings_count': 9, 'reviews_count': 49, 'text_reviews_count': 3, 'average_rating': '3.67', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '1', '4-stars': '4', '3-stars': '4', '2-stars': '0', '1-star': '0'}}",nonfiction,Thief-Taker General,9,49,3,3.67

"['Gregg Olsen', 'Rebecca Morris']",True Crime,"The Pacific Northwest is home to the world's most famous serial killers, as well as more than its share of parents who kill their children, teenagers who kill their parents, women who marry for money, naughty teachers, America's first female serial killer, and even a few who are wrongly imprisoned.New York Times bestselling author Gregg Olsen (“If Loving You Is Wrong,” “Starvation Heights”) and veteran journalist Rebecca Morris (“Ted and Ann – The Mystery of a Missing Child and Her Neighbor Ted Bundy”), take a new look at the Northwest's most notorious crimes. Many of them made history. Two – Ted Bundy's killings and Mary Kay Letourneau's teacher sex scandal – made Time magazine's list of the top crimes of the 20th century. Some are lesser known or have taken on new importance, such as one of the country's first school shootings, in Moses Lake, Washington.Cases include: Washington Barry Loukaitis – Before Sandy Hook and Columbine, there was Frontier Middle School in Moses Lake, Washington. Rosalina Misina Mendoza Dugeno Manthie Edmondson – She had many last names as she married and killed one husband after another. Ruth Neslund – Her husband thought captaining a huge freighter right into the West Seattle Bridge was the worst that could happen to him. It wasn't. Mary Kay LeTourneau – She said they were “soul mates.” He made a bet with another student that he would sleep with her. Ted Bundy – There's only one “Ted” and he remains a part of our lives. Now we've learned more about his. Kenneth Bianchi – Los Angeles' most terrifying murders were finally solved 1,200 miles north in Bellingham, Washington. With a bonus essay by Washington native Gregg Olsen on growing up in the shadow of serial killers Ted Bundy, Gary Ridgway, and Robert Lee Yates, Jr. Oregon Angela McAnulty – The mother tortured her teenage daughter until it was too late to save her. Kyron Horman – The boy with the toothy grin disappeared June 4, 2010. Why hasn't his step-mother been charged? Jeannace Freeman and Gertrude Jackson – Central Oregon was as shocked by their lesbian affair as it was by the murder of Jackson's two children. Christian Longo – He failed in his own life, so he killed his family and assumed someone else's. With two bonus essays, one by Rebecca Morris about coming of age in Oregon as serial killers trolled I-5, and one about Gregg Olsen's “date” with Oregon's most notorious murderer, Diane Downs. Idaho Shasta Groene – the brave little girl was the only survivor of a random murder and kidnapping in Coeur d'Alene.Jeralee Underwood – the eleven-year-old had the bad luck to meet a ruthless killer as she performed her favorite task of the day, delivering newspapers to her Pocatello neighborhood. Robin Row – the only woman on Idaho's Death Row, she set fires that killed her children soon after buying life insurance on them. Angie Dodge – Carol Dodge grieved her daughter's murder for years, until she became convinced the police had coerced a confession and convicted the wrong man. Now she's working for Christopher Tapp's release. Lyda Trueblood – America's first female serial killer liked to bake apple pies. She sprinkled in a secret ingredient – arsenic. Sarah Johnson – The teenager with the blonde ponytail shot her parents with a rifle, then hid her blood-spattered pink bathrobe in the family garbage. With a bonus essay from Olsen, author of the 2005 Idaho Book of the Year, The Deep Dark – Disaster and Redemption in America's Richest Silver Mine.",JGPanQEACAAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JGPanQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,1494414961,en,172, ,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,"{'ratings_count': 153, 'reviews_count': 478, 'text_reviews_count': 10, 'average_rating': '3.78', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '38', '4-stars': '54', '3-stars': '51', '2-stars': '10', '1-star': '0'}}",mystery,Bodies of Evidence (True Crime Collection),153,478,10,3.78

['R. D. Morgan'],History,"Wilbur Underhill!Xthe !?Tri-State Terror!?!Xis the Boogeyman of Depression-era outlaws in more ways than one. For nearly a decade in the turbulent period of the 1920s and 30s, he was one of the most infamous and feared criminals in the Southwest. Convicted of one of his murders in Oklahoma he was sentenced to life and escaped, killing a cop and receiving another life term in Kansas, and then escaped again, leading ten others in a mass breakout. In the last months of his life, he rose to national notoriety as a prolific bank robber and suspect in the infamous Kansas City Massacre and became the first criminal ever shot down by agents of that fledgling agency which would soon become the FBI.True criminal immortality seemed to elude Wilbur after his death, his name eclipsed in the national headlines by the likes of John Dillinger, !?Pretty Boy!? Floyd, and !?Baby Face!? Nelson. But scratch the surface and he! s still there. ?aFrom his native Joplin where Underhill began his career modestly as a !?lovers lane!? bandit, ?ato the Tri-State mining district where he is best remembered as a lone wolf scurrying about the night terrorizing the populace and committing a half-dozen robberies at gunpoint, ?ato Wichita, Kansas where he was known as a vicious cop-killer, ?ato Jeff City, Lansing, and McAlester where he became a legendary figure among the inmate populations and seemingly possessed a talent to break out at will, ?ato the Central Oklahoma oilfields and his hideouts in the wild and wooly Cookson Hills, ?ato the many towns he struck in Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Arkansas his impact is still felt.Underhill emerges from the shadows at last in this work, thanks to the tireless research of R.D.

A fictional tale inspired by ""the most viral human interest story on record,"" which had over 4 billion traditional media impressions, according to PR experts in late 2015. Fasten your seat belts for a journey filled with humor and adventure. Bachelor & newscaster Pete McCarney buys two plane tickets for a trip around the world with his girlfriend, but they split up shortly before the trip, and he can't get a refund. In a gutsy last minute move, Pete goes on social media asking for women with his girlfriend's exact name to apply to join him on the trip. Twenty-one women apply, and the ensuing interview process is both awkward and hilarious. When he finally chooses a feisty, headstrong, recently-divorced lawyer, he has no idea what to expect from their world wide adventures - and neither does Allie James.

It became a terrifying battle against storm-force winds, crashing waves and icebergs as large as cathedrals.

In three hundred and fifty-seven verses, the author, Hung Ying-ming a seventeenth-century Chinese sage explores good and evil, honesty and deception, wisdom and foolishness, and heaven and hell. He draws from the wisdom of the Three Creeds Taoism, Confucianism, and Zen Buddhism to impress upon us that by combining simple elegance with the ordinary, we can make our lives artistic and poetic. This sense, along with a particular understanding of Zen that makes art from the simple in everyday life, has permeated Chinese and Japanese culture to this day. The work is divided into two books. The first generally deals with the art of living in society and the second is concerned with man's solitude and contemplations of nature. These themes repeatedly spill over into each other, creating multiple levels of meaning.""",XKFDWoh1EdwC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XKFDWoh1EdwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,9780099482284,en,240, ,Random House,"{'ratings_count': 438, 'reviews_count': 724, 'text_reviews_count': 11, 'average_rating': '3.94', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '125', '4-stars': '183', '3-stars': '112', '2-stars': '15', '1-star': '3'}}",fiction,Safari Adventure,438,724,11,3.94

At daybreak, he gave the high-wire performance of all time, making eight crossings over the course of an hour, 110 floors up above the earth, as a hundred thousand people gathered on the ground to watch. In To Reach the Clouds, now filmed as The Walk, Philippe Petit re-creates a six-year quest to realise his dream, an adventure as thrilling as the walk itself. In an unforgettable memoir he tells the story of how he conspired, connived, improvised, and insisted his way to this 'coup', abetted by a motley crew of accomplices, the occasional miracle, and his own unflagging passion. He reveals himself to be not only a virtuoso of the air but also a bold and inspired performer on the page.

['Titus Maccius Plautus'],Drama,"""The works of Plautus,"" writes Palmer Bovie, ""mark the real beginning of Roman literature."" Now Bovie and David Slavitt have brought together a distinguished group of translators for the final two volumes of a four-volume set containing all twenty-one surviving comedies of one of Western literature's greatest dramatists. Born in Sarsina, Umbria, in 254 B.C., Plautus is said to have worked in Rome as a stage carpenter and later as a miller's helper. Whether authentic or not, these few details about the playwright's life are consistent with the image of him one might infer from his plays. Plautus was not ""literary"" but rather an energetic and resourceful man of the world who spoke the language of the people. His dramatic works were his way of describing and portraying that world in a language the people understood. Since Plautus's career unfolded against the background of the Second Punic War, it is not surprising that his prologues often end with a wish for the audience's ""good luck against your enemies"" or that the plays have their share of arrogant generals, boastful military captains, and mercenary adventurers. But other unforgettable characters are here as well—among them Euclio, in the Aulularia, the model for Molière's miser. In these lively new translations, which effectively communicate the vitality and verve of the originals, the plays of Plautus are accessible to a new generation.

['Rupert D. V. Glasgow'],Literary Criticism,"""Madness, Masks, and Laughter: An Essay on Comedy is an exploration of narrative and dramatic comedy as a laughter-inducing phenomenon. The theatrical metaphors of mask, appearance, and illusion are used as structural linchpins in an attempt to categorize the many and extremely varied manifestations of comedy and to find out what they may have in common with one another. As this reliance on metaphor suggests, the purpose is less to produce The Truth about comedy than to look at how it is related to our understanding of the world and to ways of understanding our understanding. Previous theories of comedy or laughter (such as those advanced by Hobbes, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Bergson, Freud, and Bakhtin) as well as more general philosophical considerations are discussed insofar as they shed light on this approach. The limitations of the metaphors themselves mean that sight is never lost of the deep-seated ambiguity that has made laughter so notoriously difficult to pin down in the past."" ""The first half of the volume focuses in particular on traditional comic masks and the pleasures of repetition and recognition, on the comedy of imposture, disguise, and deception, on dramatic and verbal irony, on social and theatrical role-playing and the comic possibilities of plays-within-plays and ""metatheatre,"" as well as on the cliches, puns, witticisms, and torrents of gibberish which betray that language itself may be understood as a sort of mask. The second half of the book moves to the other side of the footlights to show how the spectators themselves, identifying with the comic spectacle, may be induced to ""drop"" their own roles and postures, laughter here operating as something akin to a ventilatory release from the pressures of social or cognitive performance. Here the essay examines the subversive madness inherent in comedy, its displaced anti-authoritarianism, as well as the violence, sexuality, and bodily grotesqueness it may bring to light. The structural tensions in this broadly Hobbesian or Freudian model of a social mask concealing an anti-social self are reflected in comedy's own ambivalences, and emerge especially in the ambiguous concepts of madness and folly, which may be either celebrated as festive fun or derided as sinfulness. The study concludes by considering the ways in which nonsense and the grotesque may infringe our cognitive limitations, here extending the distinction between appearance and reality to a metaphysical level which is nonetheless prey to unresolvable ambiguities."" ""The scope of the comic material ranges over time from Aristophanes to Martin Amis, from Boccaccio, Chaucer, Rabelais, and Shakespeare to Oscar Wilde, Joe Orton, John Barth, and Philip Roth. Alongside mainly Old Greek, Italian, French, Irish, English, and American examples, a number of relatively little-known German plays (by Grabbe, Tieck, Buchner, and others) are also taken into consideration.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

But the one named Phoebe, with the plain face, is a sparkling lass whose heart flutters for a bachelor by the name of Valentine, who is expected on a visit. Sadly we learn, Valentine, has come back not to propose to Miss Phoebe but to announce his enlistment in the Napoleonic wars. And Phoebe and her sister have met economic misfortune by teaching at a primary school. Rejuvenated by his return, Phoebe in a carefree moment discards her prim clothes and expression, and becomes a gay young girl, extravagant with her smiles, as well as with her dances at the military balls. The transformation is so complete that Phoebe is mistaken for a fictitious niece. The deception increases the merriment and produces many sudden changes of the plot. Valentine discovers his love for Phoebe, and then fortunately discovers the precarious plot in time to save it from the mischievous women. Surely this is one of the most endearing and enduring of all comedies.",5zrHVAZHh3YC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5zrHVAZHh3YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0573614520,en,126, ,"Samuel French, Inc.","{'ratings_count': 71, 'reviews_count': 212, 'text_reviews_count': 10, 'average_rating': '3.73', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '17', '4-stars': '25', '3-stars': '23', '2-stars': '5', '1-star': '1'}}",fiction,Quality Street,71,212,10,3.73

"['Athene Seyler', 'Stephen Haggard', 'Robert Barton']",Performing Arts,"""a work on the art and craft of comedy as important in its own way as works by Stanislavski and Chekhov"" – Oxford Theatre Companion In 1939, a young, inexperienced actor wrote to a famous actress of his acquaintance, asking for advice on playing comedy. She responded enthusiastically, and they corresponded variously over the next year. The Craft of Comedy, a record of these exchanges, soon emerged as one of the few classic texts in the field of comedy acting. This major new edition takes a brilliant book and makes it better. Editor Robert Barton has devised extensive supplementary material, including: An introduction to the correspondents, the culture of the time, and the evolution of their book; Summaries, definitions, and exercises and practice scenes for readers wishing to explore Athene Seyler's invaluable advice; Photographs, additional essays by Seyler, and a guide to easily accessed video clips of her performing. Seyler's lucid guidance, and Barton's scrupulous editorship, ensure this legendary work's rightful status is restored: as one of the great practical guides to the craft of comedy, and an essential resource for actors and students of acting.",VV7ghVpxi4wC,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VV7ghVpxi4wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780415527231,en,176, ,Routledge,"{'ratings_count': 14, 'reviews_count': 41, 'text_reviews_count': 1, 'average_rating': '3.86', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '4', '4-stars': '5', '3-stars': '4', '2-stars': '1', '1-star': '0'}}",stage,The Craft of Comedy,14,41,1,3.86
"[""Daphne Elizabeth O'Regan""]",Literary Criticism,"This is an intelligent and unusually thought-provoking reading of Aristophanes' Clouds. O'Regan focuses on logos, or the power of argument, and its effects, and on the self-awareness of the second Clouds as a comedy of logos directed toward an audience made resistant by devotion to the body. Within and without the play, logos meets defeat when confronted with human nature and desire. The argument conveys much insight into fifth-century thought and the play's workings, the more so because it balances rhetoric with comedy, and reminds the reader that this is a comic logos--explored in the comic mode, and connected with the intentions and vicissitudes of the first and second Clouds.",ObXnCwAAQBAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ObXnCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,9780195070170,en,224, ,Oxford University Press on Demand,"{'ratings_count': 3, 'reviews_count': 9, 'text_reviews_count': 0, 'average_rating': '4.00', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '0', '4-stars': '3', '3-stars': '0', '2-stars': '0', '1-star': '0'}}",box-19,"Rhetoric, Comedy, and the Violence of Language in Aristophanes' Clouds",3,9,0,4.00

Both her public accomplishments and private emotional conflicts are thoroughly examined by an unnamed interviewer who questions the posthumous Nevelson with an unabashed scrutiny.

['Kliph Nesteroff'],History,"InThe Comedians, comedy historian Kliph Nesteroff brings to life a century of American comedy with real-life characters, forgotten stars, mainstream heroes and counterculture iconoclasts. Based on over two hundred original interviews and extensive archival research, Nesteroff's groundbreaking work is a narrative exploration of the way comedians have reflected, shaped, and changed American culture over the past one hundred years. Starting with the vaudeville circuit at the turn of the last century, Nesteroff introduces the first stand-up comedian--an emcee who abandoned physical shtick for straight jokes. After the repeal of Prohibition, Mafia-run supper clubs replaced speakeasies, and mobsters replaced vaudeville impresarios as the comedian's primary employer. In the 1950s, the late-night talk show brought stand-up to a wide public, while Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl, and Jonathan Winters attacked conformity andstaged a comedy rebellion in coffeehouses. From comedy's part in the Civil Rights movement and the social upheaval of the late 1960s, to the first comedy clubs of the 1970s and the cocaine-fueled comedy boom of the 1980s,The Comedians culminates with a new era of media-driven celebrity in the twenty-first century.",BGn_rQEACAAJ,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BGn_rQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0802123988,en,432, , ,"{'ratings_count': 1701, 'reviews_count': 4993, 'text_reviews_count': 272, 'average_rating': '3.97', 'rating_dist': {'5-stars': '521', '4-stars': '720', '3-stars': '365', '2-stars': '83', '1-star': '12'}}",history,The Comedians,1701,4993,272,3.97
['David Selbourne'],Comedy,"This is an unusual and important book. As the sub-title records, it is 'an eye-witness account of Peter Brook's production from first rehearsal to first night.' The production in question was a famous one that had its opening night on 27 August 1970. Audiences loved it, as, indeed, did most critics, Clive Barnes of the New York Times going so far as to say, 'It is a magnificent production, the most important yet of the world's most imaginative and inventive director. If Peter Brook had done nothing else but this Dream, he would have deserved a place in theatre history.' All the more reason therefore to be grateful for this unique account of this production's gestation during its weeks of rehearsals. In a typically stimulating preface, David Selbourne concludes by saying, 'What follows, then, is not hindsight. It is, instead, an attempt to reinstate the true density of first impressions . . . as well as to recover fleeting moments in the posthumous life of Shakespeare's writing, in one of the very greatest of his plays.' Simon Trussler, in his introduction, judges it to be 'an important work, both in the critical portrait it offers of a leading director at work, and in its demonstration of the kinds of bluff, self-deception, and unhappy accident that can as much contribute to the making of a theatrical 'triumph' as our more orthodox expectations of creative struggle, fruitful improvisation, and dialectic discovery - present in full measure though these undoubtedly were. All the ingredients are there in the seven-week mix of rehearsals of which the detailed record now follows. ' 'An indispensable theatre book . . . It explains more than we could have hoped how the miracle was wrought.' John Barber, Daily Telegraph 'The process of theatrical creation comes across with rare force, expressed in language - Mr Selbourne writes very well - of rare beauty.'
